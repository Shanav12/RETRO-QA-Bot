This model integrates the power of [Langchain](https://langchain.ai/) and [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), providing you with a whole new level of document querying efficiency. 

Langchain, an advanced language model, works to understand the semantic context of your documents, ensuring precise and relevant search results. Coupled with Pinecone's vector indexing capabilities, we are able to store, search, and manage the information in your documents like never before!

### 🔍 Llama-Index Model

Our Llama-Index Model goes one step further, taking your search experience to unprecedented heights! This model doesn't just understand the question it grasps the context too. It has far greater hallucination reduction and makes inferences on the context as well.

The [Llama Index](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) utilizes the most recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to provide context-aware search results. Whether you are looking for a detailed answer or a quick fact, Llama-Index ensures you find the most accurate and relevant information, fast!
