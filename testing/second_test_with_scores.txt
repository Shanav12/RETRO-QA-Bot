Question: What are the four conditions called the group axioms in mathematics?   Answer: The four conditions called the group axioms in mathematics are closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.   Context: In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element. The operation satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely. It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.   Score: 0.851364255 
Question: What is the tripedal gait and how do insects use it for walking?   Answer: The tripedal gait is a type of locomotion used by insects for walking. It involves the insect using three of its legs to form a stable triangle on the ground, while the other three legs are lifted and moved forward to a new position. This allows the insect to move quickly while maintaining a stable stance. When moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.   Context: Many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in cockroaches. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.

Question: What was the last heavily used electric streetcar line in Detroit and when was it replaced?   Answer: The last heavily used electric streetcar line in Detroit was along the length of Woodward Avenue and it was replaced with gas-powered buses in 1956.   Context: As in other major American cities in the postwar era, construction of an extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used electric streetcar line along the length of Woodward Avenue was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds.   Score: 0.881049812 
Question: What was the significance of Massalia during the Hellenistic period in Gaul?   Answer: The significance of Massalia during the Hellenistic period in Gaul was that it was the first Greek colony in the region, and it became one of the largest trading ports of the Mediterranean. It was also the local hegemon, controlling various coastal Greek cities, and its coins were found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Massalia was also a center of education, where Celts went to learn Greek, and it established overland trade routes deep into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy. Finally, Massalia was a staunch ally of Rome until it sided with Pompey in 49 BCE.   Context: Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul were mostly limited to the Mediterranean coast of Provence. The first Greek colony in the region was Massalia, which became one of the largest trading ports of Mediterranean by the 4th century BCE with 6,000 inhabitants. Massalia was also the local hegemon, controlling various coastal Greek cities like Nice and Agde. The coins minted in Massalia have been found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Celtic coinage was influenced by Greek designs, and Greek letters can be found on various Celtic coins, especially those of Southern France. Traders from Massalia ventured inland deep into France on the Rivers Durance and Rhône, and established overland trade routes deep into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy. The Hellenistic period saw the Greek alphabet spread into southern Gaul from Massalia (3rd and 2nd centuries BCE) and according to Strabo, Massalia was also a center of education, where Celts went to learn Greek. A staunch ally of Rome, Massalia retained its independence until it sided with Pompey in 49 BCE and was then taken by Caesar's forces.   Score: 0.913729131 
Question: What is the historical significance of the Tosei-gusoku armor in relation to the development of samurai warfare tactics and the modernization of Japan's defenses?   Answer: The Tosei-gusoku armor was a major factor in the development of samurai warfare tactics and the modernization of Japan's defenses. The armor was designed to provide additional protection against firearms and new fighting tactics, and its use marked a shift away from the traditional kozane dou armor made from individual scales. The use of the Tosei-gusoku armor was a sign of the changing times, as Japan began to modernize its defenses and move away from the traditional samurai warfare tactics. The last known use of samurai armor was in 1877 during the Satsuma Rebellion, which marked the end of the samurai era and the beginning of a new era of conscription armies and uniforms.   Context: In the 1500s a new type of armor started to become popular due to the advent of firearms, new fighting tactics and the need for additional protection. The kozane dou made from individual scales was replaced by plate armor. This new armor, which used iron plated dou (dō), was referred to as Tosei-gusoku, or modern armor. Various other components of armor protected the samurai's body. The helmet kabuto was an important part of the samurai's armor. Samurai armor changed and developed as the methods of samurai warfare changed over the centuries. The known last use of samurai armor occurring in 1877 during the satsuma rebellion.

Question: What is the source of fresh water for the Miami metropolitan area and how does it affect underground construction in the city?   Answer: The source of fresh water for the Miami metropolitan area is the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay. This aquifer impedes underground construction in the city, as it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water. As a result, the mass transit systems in and around Miami are elevated or at-grade.   Context: Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay, with its highest point peaking around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah. Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist.

Question: What is the history and significance of the honor code at Brigham Young University?   Answer: The honor code at Brigham Young University has a long history, dating back to the days of the Brigham Young Academy and early school President Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the "Domestic Organization", which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to ensure they were following the school's moral rules. The Honor Code itself was not created until about 1940, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. President Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards, such as rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to the honor code, and those found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. The honor code is seen by some Latter-day Saints, as well as some university and church leaders, as a way to help BYU fulfill its mission as an "ambassador" to the world for the LDS Church and thus, for Jesus Christ. Various LGBT advocacy groups have protested the honor code and criticized it as being anti-gay, and The Princeton Review ranked BYU as the 3rd most LGBT-unfriendly school in the United States.   Context: All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to an honor code. Early forms of the Church Educational System Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy and early school President Karl G. Maeser.

Question: What is the difference between RAM and ROM in terms of their functionality and data retention?   Answer: The main difference between RAM and ROM is their functionality and data retention. RAM is a type of memory that can be read from and written to by the CPU, and its contents are erased when the power to the computer is turned off. ROM, on the other hand, is preloaded with data and software that never changes, and the CPU can only read from it. ROM typically stores the computer's initial start-up instructions, and its contents are retained indefinitely even when the power to the computer is turned off. Flash memory is a type of memory that blurs the distinction between RAM and ROM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable.   Context: RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software. Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.   Score: 0.886971414 
Question: What is the composition of a bacterial cell wall and how does it differ from the cell walls of plants, fungi, and Archaea?   Answer: The composition of a bacterial cell wall is peptidoglycan, which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. This is different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan, but instead contain a similar substance called pseudopeptidoglycan.   Context: In most bacteria, a cell wall is present on the outside of the cell membrane. The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope. A common bacterial cell wall material is peptidoglycan (called "murein" in older sources), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan.   Score: 0.878877282
