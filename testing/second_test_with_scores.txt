Question: What are the four conditions called the group axioms in mathematics?   Answer: The four conditions called the group axioms in mathematics are closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.   Context: In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element. The operation satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely. It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.   Score: 0.851364255 
Question: What is the tripedal gait and how do insects use it for walking?   Answer: The tripedal gait is a type of locomotion used by insects for walking. It involves the insect using three of its legs to form a stable triangle on the ground, while the other three legs are lifted and moved forward to a new position. This allows the insect to move quickly while maintaining a stable stance. When moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.   Context: Many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in cockroaches. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.

Question: What was the last heavily used electric streetcar line in Detroit and when was it replaced?   Answer: The last heavily used electric streetcar line in Detroit was along the length of Woodward Avenue and it was replaced with gas-powered buses in 1956.   Context: As in other major American cities in the postwar era, construction of an extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used electric streetcar line along the length of Woodward Avenue was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds.   Score: 0.881049812 
Question: What was the significance of Massalia during the Hellenistic period in Gaul?   Answer: The significance of Massalia during the Hellenistic period in Gaul was that it was the first Greek colony in the region, and it became one of the largest trading ports of the Mediterranean. It was also the local hegemon, controlling various coastal Greek cities, and its coins were found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Massalia was also a center of education, where Celts went to learn Greek, and it established overland trade routes deep into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy. Finally, Massalia was a staunch ally of Rome until it sided with Pompey in 49 BCE.   Context: Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul were mostly limited to the Mediterranean coast of Provence. The first Greek colony in the region was Massalia, which became one of the largest trading ports of Mediterranean by the 4th century BCE with 6,000 inhabitants. Massalia was also the local hegemon, controlling various coastal Greek cities like Nice and Agde. The coins minted in Massalia have been found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Celtic coinage was influenced by Greek designs, and Greek letters can be found on various Celtic coins, especially those of Southern France. Traders from Massalia ventured inland deep into France on the Rivers Durance and Rhône, and established overland trade routes deep into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy. The Hellenistic period saw the Greek alphabet spread into southern Gaul from Massalia (3rd and 2nd centuries BCE) and according to Strabo, Massalia was also a center of education, where Celts went to learn Greek. A staunch ally of Rome, Massalia retained its independence until it sided with Pompey in 49 BCE and was then taken by Caesar's forces.   Score: 0.913729131 
Question: What is the historical significance of the Tosei-gusoku armor in relation to the development of samurai warfare tactics and the modernization of Japan's defenses?   Answer: The Tosei-gusoku armor was a major factor in the development of samurai warfare tactics and the modernization of Japan's defenses. The armor was designed to provide additional protection against firearms and new fighting tactics, and its use marked a shift away from the traditional kozane dou armor made from individual scales. The use of the Tosei-gusoku armor was a sign of the changing times, as Japan began to modernize its defenses and move away from the traditional samurai warfare tactics. The last known use of samurai armor was in 1877 during the Satsuma Rebellion, which marked the end of the samurai era and the beginning of a new era of conscription armies and uniforms.   Context: In the 1500s a new type of armor started to become popular due to the advent of firearms, new fighting tactics and the need for additional protection. The kozane dou made from individual scales was replaced by plate armor. This new armor, which used iron plated dou (dō), was referred to as Tosei-gusoku, or modern armor. Various other components of armor protected the samurai's body. The helmet kabuto was an important part of the samurai's armor. Samurai armor changed and developed as the methods of samurai warfare changed over the centuries. The known last use of samurai armor occurring in 1877 during the satsuma rebellion.

Question: What were the challenges faced by the allied armies during the Crimean War, specifically in terms of supply and communication?   Answer: The allied armies faced a number of challenges during the Crimean War, specifically in terms of supply and communication. The deteriorating supply situation on both sides of troops and materiel led to a halt in ground operations. The storm on 14 November sank thirty allied transport ships, including one carrying a cargo of winter clothing, and the heavy traffic caused the road from the coast to the troops to disintegrate into a quagmire. This required engineers to devote most of their time to its repair, including quarrying stone. The installation of an Electrical telegraph was also delayed due to the frozen ground, and the Pipe-and-cable-laying plough failed because of the hard frozen soil. Despite these challenges, 21 miles of cable were laid.   Context: Winter, and a deteriorating supply situation on both sides of troops and materiel, led to a halt in ground operations.

Question: What is the source of fresh water for the Miami metropolitan area and how does it affect underground construction in the city?   Answer: The source of fresh water for the Miami metropolitan area is the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay. This aquifer impedes underground construction in the city, as it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water. As a result, the mass transit systems in and around Miami are elevated or at-grade.   Context: Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay, with its highest point peaking around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah. Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist.

Question: What is the relationship between the Age of Enlightenment and the development of modern sociology?   Answer: The Age of Enlightenment had a direct influence on the development of modern sociology. Hume's philosophical concepts, which were popularised by Dugald Stewart, provided the basis for classical liberalism, which in turn had a direct influence on the development of modern sociology. Additionally, the Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a 'science of man' which merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity.

Question: What is the history and significance of the honor code at Brigham Young University?   Answer: The honor code at Brigham Young University has a long history, dating back to the days of the Brigham Young Academy and early school President Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the "Domestic Organization", which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to ensure they were following the school's moral rules. The Honor Code itself was not created until about 1940, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. President Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards, such as rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to the honor code, and those found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. The honor code is seen by some Latter-day Saints, as well as some university and church leaders, as a way to help BYU fulfill its mission as an "ambassador" to the world for the LDS Church and thus, for Jesus Christ. Various LGBT advocacy groups have protested the honor code and criticized it as being anti-gay, and The Princeton Review ranked BYU as the 3rd most LGBT-unfriendly school in the United States.

Question: What is the difference between RAM and ROM in terms of their functionality and data retention?   Answer: The main difference between RAM and ROM is their functionality and data retention. RAM is a type of memory that can be read from and written to by the CPU, and its contents are erased when the power to the computer is turned off. ROM, on the other hand, is preloaded with data and software that never changes, and the CPU can only read from it. ROM typically stores the computer's initial start-up instructions, and its contents are retained indefinitely even when the power to the computer is turned off. Flash memory is a type of memory that blurs the distinction between RAM and ROM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable.   Context: RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software. Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.   Score: 0.886971414 
Question: What is the composition of a bacterial cell wall and how does it differ from the cell walls of plants, fungi, and Archaea?   Answer: The composition of a bacterial cell wall is peptidoglycan, which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. This is different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan, but instead contain a similar substance called pseudopeptidoglycan.   Context: In most bacteria, a cell wall is present on the outside of the cell membrane. The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope. A common bacterial cell wall material is peptidoglycan (called "murein" in older sources), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively.

Question: What are the group axioms in mathematics and how do they define a group?   Answer: The group axioms in mathematics are closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. These axioms define a group by requiring that the operation that combines any two elements to form a third element must satisfy the four conditions. Closure states that the result of combining two elements must also be an element of the group. Associativity states that the order in which two elements are combined does not affect the result. Identity states that there must be an element in the group that, when combined with any other element, produces the same element. Invertibility states that for every element in the group, there must be an inverse element that, when combined with the original element, produces the identity element.   Context: In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element. The operation satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely. It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.   Score: 0.893306 
Question: What is the tripedal gait and how do insects use it for walking?   Answer: The tripedal gait is a type of locomotion used by insects for walking. It involves the insect using three of its legs to form a stable triangle on the ground, while the other three legs are lifted and moved forward to a new position. This allows the insect to move quickly while maintaining a stable stance. When moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.   Context: Many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in cockroaches. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.

The availability of cars and the ease of commuting by car also played a role in the suburbanization of Detroit.   Context: As in other major American cities in the postwar era, construction of an extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used electric streetcar line along the length of Woodward Avenue was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses.

Answer: The source of fresh water for the Miami metropolitan area is the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay. This aquifer makes it impossible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist.   Context: Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay, with its highest point peaking around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah. Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist. For this reason, the mass transit systems in and around Miami are elevated or at-grade.[citation needed]   Score: 0.895632863 
Question: What territorial dispute is Vietnam involved in and how has the Vietnamese government tried to prevent protests during the torch relay?   Answer: Vietnam is involved in a territorial dispute with China (and other countries) for sovereignty of the Spratly and Paracel Islands. To prevent protests during the torch relay, the Vietnamese government has actively sought to head off protests by arresting anti-China protestors, deporting a Vietnamese American for planning protests, arresting a prominent blogger, and updating the official Beijing Olympic website to remove the disputed islands and dotted lines marking China's maritime claims in the South China Sea.   Context: Vietnam: The event was held in Ho Chi Minh City on April 29. Some 60 torchbearers carried the torch from the downtown Opera House to the Military Zone 7 Competition Hall stadium near Tan Son Nhat International Airport along an undisclosed route. Vietnam is involved in a territorial dispute with China (and other countries) for sovereignty of the Spratly and Paracel Islands; tensions have risen recently[when?] following reports that the Chinese government had established a county-level city named Sansha in the disputed territories, resulting in anti-Chinese demonstrations in December 2007 in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Question: What notable achievements occurred during President Henry S. Bienen's tenure at Northwestern University?   Answer: During President Henry S. Bienen's tenure at Northwestern University, there was a notable increase in the number and quality of undergraduate applicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty, and renewed athletic competitiveness. Additionally, Northwestern student journalists uncovered information exonerating Illinois death row inmate Anthony Porter two days before his scheduled execution, and the Innocence Project has since exonerated 10 more men.   Context: Though government support for universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s, President Arnold R. Weber was able to stabilize university finances, leading to a revitalization of the campuses. As admissions to colleges and universities grew increasingly competitive in the 1990s and 2000s, President Henry S. Bienen's tenure saw a notable increase in the number and quality of undergraduate applicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty, and renewed athletic competitiveness. In 1999, Northwestern student journalists uncovered information exonerating Illinois death row inmate Anthony Porter two days before his scheduled execution, and the Innocence Project has since exonerated 10 more men.

Question: What are the principles of morphological derivation in Catalan and how does it compare to other Romance languages?   Answer: The principles of morphological derivation in Catalan are similar to those of other Romance languages, in that agglutination is common. This means that multiple affixes are often added to a preexisting lexeme, and sound alternations can occur. Prefixes are usually added to verbs. This process is similar to other Romance languages, as they also use agglutination and sound alternations.   Context: The process of morphological derivation in Catalan follows the same principles as the other Romance languages, where agglutination is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example elèctric [əˈlɛktrik] ("electrical") vs. electricitat [ələktrisiˈtat].

Question: What is the basis of classical liberalism according to Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers?   Answer: The basis of classical liberalism according to Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers is Hume's philosophical concepts, which directly influenced James Madison (and thus the U.S. Constitution) and were popularised by Dugald Stewart.   Context: Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a 'science of man', which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar, and William Robertson, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity. Modern sociology largely originated from this movement, and Hume's philosophical concepts that directly influenced James Madison (and thus the U.S. Constitution) and as popularised by Dugald Stewart, would be the basis of classical liberalism.

ROM (Read-Only Memory) is a type of non-volatile memory that is preloaded with data and software that never changes, so the CPU can only read from it. RAM is used to store data and programs that are currently being used, while ROM is used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. RAM is erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely.   Context: RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software. Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.   Score: 0.886830807 
Question: What is the composition of the cell wall in most bacteria and how does it differ from the cell walls of plants, fungi, and Archaea?   Answer: Most bacteria have a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan, which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. This is different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan, but instead contain a similar substance called pseudopeptidoglycan.   Context: In most bacteria, a cell wall is present on the outside of the cell membrane. The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope. A common bacterial cell wall material is peptidoglycan (called "murein" in older sources), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan.   Score: 0.882178485

Question: What are some biblical references that support the title of Queen Mother being given to Mary, the mother of Jesus?   Answer: The biblical references that support the title of Queen Mother being given to Mary, the mother of Jesus, are found in the Gospel of Luke 1:32, the Book of Isaiah 9:6, 1 Kings 2:19-20, and Jeremiah 13:18-19.   Context: Some titles have a Biblical basis, for instance the title Queen Mother has been given to Mary since she was the mother of Jesus, who was sometimes referred to as the "King of Kings" due to his lineage of King David. The biblical basis for the term Queen can be seen in the Gospel of Luke 1:32 and the Book of Isaiah 9:6, and Queen Mother from 1 Kings 2:19-20 and Jeremiah 13:18-19.

Question: What is the context of the elevator mentioned in the given text?   Answer: The context of the elevator mentioned in the given text is the social and cultural impacts caused by the modern elevator, including thriller movies about stuck elevators, casual encounters and sexual tension on elevators, the reduction of personal space, and concerns about personal hygiene. Additionally, the text also mentions the use of elevators during up-peak mode, such as recalling elevator cars to the lobby to provide expeditious service to passengers arriving at the building, and dispatching elevators one-by-one when they reach a pre-determined passenger load.   Context: Elevators necessitated new social protocols. When Nicholas II of Russia visited the Hotel Adlon in Berlin, his courtiers panicked about who would enter the elevator first, and who would press the buttons.

Question: What was the significance of Massalia in pre-Roman Gaul and how did it contribute to the spread of Greek culture in southern Gaul during the Hellenistic period?   Answer: Massalia was the first Greek colony in pre-Roman Gaul and was one of the largest trading ports of the Mediterranean by the 4th century BCE. It was also the local hegemon, controlling various coastal Greek cities like Nice and Agde. Massalia's coins were found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul, and its influence on Celtic coinage was evident. Traders from Massalia ventured inland deep into France on the Rivers Durance and Rhône, and established overland trade routes deep into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy. During the Hellenistic period, Massalia was a center of education, where Celts went to learn Greek, and the Greek alphabet spread into southern Gaul from Massalia (3rd and 2nd centuries BCE). Massalia was a staunch ally of Rome, and retained its independence until it sided with Pompey in 49 BCE and was then taken by Caesar's forces.   Context: Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul were mostly limited to the Mediterranean coast of Provence. The first Greek colony in the region was Massalia, which became one of the largest trading ports of Mediterranean by the 4th century BCE with 6,000 inhabitants. Massalia was also the local hegemon, controlling various coastal Greek cities like Nice and Agde. The coins minted in Massalia have been found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Celtic coinage was influenced by Greek designs, and Greek letters can be found on various Celtic coins, especially those of Southern France. Traders from Massalia ventured inland deep into France on the Rivers Durance and Rhône, and established overland trade routes deep into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy. The Hellenistic period saw the Greek alphabet spread into southern Gaul from Massalia (3rd and 2nd centuries BCE) and according to Strabo, Massalia was also a center of education, where Celts went to learn Greek.

Question: What is the concept of judicial review and how was it established in the United States Constitution?   Answer: Judicial review is the power of the courts to review the actions of the executive and legislative branches of government and to declare them unconstitutional if they are found to be in violation of the Constitution. It was established in the United States Constitution through the Supreme Court's decision in Marbury v. Madison. This decision established the precedent that a court may strike down a law it deems unconstitutional.   Context: Courts check both the executive branch and the legislative branch through judicial review. This concept is not written into the Constitution, but was envisioned by many of the Constitution's Framers (for example, The Federalist Papers mention it). The Supreme Court established a precedent for judicial review in Marbury v. Madison. There were protests by some at this decision, born chiefly of political expediency, but political realities in the particular case paradoxically restrained opposing views from asserting themselves. For this reason, precedent alone established the principle that a court may strike down a law it deems unconstitutional.   Score: 0.888897657

Question: What are some cultural beliefs that have rationalized child labour in European history and contemporary child labour in the modern world?   Answer: Some cultural beliefs that have rationalized child labour in European history and contemporary child labour in the modern world include the belief that work is good for the character-building and skill development of children, the cultural tradition of children following in their parents' footsteps, and the devaluation of the education of girls.   Context: In European history when child labour was common, as well as in contemporary child labour of modern world, certain cultural beliefs have rationalised child labour and thereby encouraged it. Some view that work is good for the character-building and skill development of children. In many cultures, particular where the informal economy and small household businesses thrive, the cultural tradition is that children follow in their parents' footsteps; child labour then is a means to learn and practice that trade from a very early age. Similarly, in many cultures the education of girls is less valued or girls are simply not expected to need formal schooling, and these girls pushed into child labour such as providing domestic services.

Question: What were the origins of the department store and how did the growth of the conspicuous consumer society contribute to its development?   Answer: The origins of the department store lay in the growth of the conspicuous consumer society at the turn of the 19th century. As the Industrial Revolution accelerated economy expansion, the affluent middle-class grew in size and wealth. This urbanized social group, sharing a culture of consumption and changing fashion, was the catalyst for the retail revolution. As rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people, especially women, with disposable income in the late Georgian period, window shopping was transformed into a leisure activity and entrepreneurs, like the potter Josiah Wedgwood, pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence the prevailing tastes and preferences of society. The growth of the conspicuous consumer society allowed for the development of the department store, as it provided a larger market for goods and services, and allowed for the growth of marketing techniques to influence consumer tastes.

Question: What were the effects of the global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian and the mid-Carboniferous on the Earth's geological history?   Answer: The global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian created widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian, while the mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America also separated the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period. Additionally, the drop in south polar temperatures caused southern Gondwana to be glaciated throughout the period. The deep tropics, however, were largely unaffected by these changes.   Context: A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers.

Question: What is the purpose of the counterweight in an elevator and how does it reduce the amount of power needed to move the cab?   Answer: The purpose of the counterweight in an elevator is to reduce the amount of power needed to move the cab. The counterweight is attached to the opposite end of the cables that are looped over the drive sheave. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40-50% of the capacity of the elevator. This counterweight reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab by providing an opposing force to the cab, thus reducing the amount of power needed to move the cab.   Context: In each case, cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be "underslung" below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a counterweight attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab. The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and rides a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerized device that directs starting, acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40-50% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. "Traction" is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalization may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes.   Score: 0.878013194 
Question: What is the title of the text and what is the content of the text?   Answer: The title of the text is Textual Criticism and the content of the text is about the process of analyzing ancient texts to determine their original form and meaning. It discusses how this process is applied to works such as the Bible and the Greek tragedies, as well as the Qur'an. It also mentions how English scholarly editions have tended to use notes at the foot of the text page to draw attention to alternative forms of the text.

After 1998 they were upgraded to institutions which are allowed to confer bachelor's degrees (the Portuguese licenciatura). Before then, they only awarded short-cycle degrees which were known as bacharelatos and did not provide further education. After the Bologna Process in 2007, they have been allowed to offer 2nd cycle (master's) degrees to its students. The polytechnical higher education system provides a more practical training and is profession-oriented, while the university higher education system has a strong theoretical basis and is highly research-oriented.

Question: What are the three Germanic dialects originally spoken in the Low Countries and how did they develop into Old Dutch, Middle Dutch, and Modern Dutch?   Answer: The three Germanic dialects originally spoken in the Low Countries were Frisian in the north and along the western coast, Saxon in the east, and Franconian in the centre and south. The Franconian dialects developed into Old Dutch, which then developed into Middle Dutch and later Modern Dutch. The transition between these development phases was gradual, but the emergence of the Dutch standard language marked a revolution in the development of the Dutch language.   Context: Three Germanic dialects were originally spoken in the Low Countries: Frisian in the north and along the western coast; Saxon in the east (contiguous with the Low German area); and Franconian in the centre and south. It is the Franconian dialects that is designated as Old Dutch, and that would develop in Middle Dutch and later Modern Dutch. The division in these development phases is mostly conventional, since the transition between them was very gradual. One of the few moments linguists can detect somewhat of a revolution is when the Dutch standard language emerged and quickly established itself. The development of the Dutch language is illustrated by the following sentence in Old, Middle and Modern Dutch:   Score: 0.921482444 
Question: What report by the International Energy Agency in 2011 found that solar energy technologies could potentially provide a third of the world's energy by 2060 if climate change is limited and politicians commit to it?   Answer: The report by the International Energy Agency in 2011 found that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaics, solar hot water and concentrated solar power could potentially provide a third of the world's energy by 2060 if climate change is limited and politicians commit to it.

Question: What is the historical significance of Zhejiang in terms of its economic richness and its role in the expansion of the Sui dynasty?   Answer: Zhejiang has historically been an important economic center in China, with its economic richness being used to fund the ambitions of the Sui dynasty to expand north and south. The Grand Canal, which was restored and expanded by the Sui dynasty, regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang to the North China Plain and metropolitan centers of the empire. This allowed the Sui dynasty to expand its influence and power, and helped to create a golden age for the country.   Context: Zhejiang, as the heartland of the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta), remained the wealthiest area during the Six Dynasties (220 or 222–589), Sui, and Tang. After being incorporated into the Sui dynasty, its economic richness was used for the Sui dynasty's ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into Korea and Vietnam. The plan led the Sui dynasty to restore and expand the network which became the Grand Canal of China. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the Zhe River and the shores of Hangzhou Bay), and from Suzhou, and thence to the North China Plain. The débâcle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the Tang, who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire's Jiangnan East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous. Throughout the Tang dynasty, The Grand Canal had remained effective, transporting grains and material resources to North China plain and metropolitan centers of the empire. As the Tang Dynasty disintegrated, Zhejiang constituted most of the territory of the regional kingdom of Wuyue.   Score: 0.88705343 
Question: What are some characteristics of the Euornithes avialan lineage?   Answer: Some characteristics of the Euornithes avialan lineage include: semi-aquatic habitats, specialized in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms, lack of perching adaptations, shorebird-like species, waders, swimming and diving species, strongly keeled breastbones, toothless beaked portions of their jaws, development of true pygostyle, fully mobile fan of tail feathers, and the evolution of a better sense of smell.   Context: Many species of the second major avialan lineage to diversify, the Euornithes (meaning "true birds", because they include the ancestors of modern birds), were semi-aquatic and specialized in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms. Unlike the enantiornithes, which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats, most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebird-like species, waders, and swimming and diving species. The later included the superficially gull-like Ichthyornis, the Hesperornithiformes, which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic. The early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws). Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers, which may have replaced the "hind wing" as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.

Question: What were the primary aims of the English and Dutch joint-stock companies formed in the 16th century to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia?   Answer: The primary aims of the English and Dutch joint-stock companies formed in the 16th century to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia were to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India.   Context: At the end of the 16th century, England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private joint-stock companies to finance the voyages—the English, later British, East India Company and the Dutch East India Company, chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other. Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.

Question: What is the first step in the beer-making process called and what does it involve?   Answer: The first step in the beer-making process is called "mashing" and it involves mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains.   Context: The first step, where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, is known as "mashing". Hot water (known as "liquor" in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as "grist") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.   Score: 0.877751708

Answer: Some of the tunnels that link Manhattan Island to New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey are the Lincoln Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, and the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel.   Context: Manhattan Island is linked to New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey by several tunnels as well. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world. The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940.

Question: What were some examples of home-based manufacturing operations that involved child labor in different countries?   Answer: Examples of home-based manufacturing operations that involved child labor in different countries include garment production in France, shoe production in Germany, artificial flower production in the United States, match box production in the United States, toy production in the United States, umbrella production in the United States, and other product production in the United States. In Australia, Britain, and Austria, child labor was also common in home-based agricultural operations.   Context: Home-based manufacturing operations were active year round. Families willingly deployed their children in these income generating home enterprises. In many cases, men worked from home. In France, over 58 percent of garment workers operated out of their homes; in Germany, the number of full-time home operations nearly doubled between 1882 and 1907; and in the United States, millions of families operated out of home seven days a week, year round to produce garments, shoes, artificial flowers, feathers, match boxes, toys, umbrellas and other products. Children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common. Rural areas similarly saw families deploying their children in agriculture.

Question: What changes did Madonna notice in her mother's behavior and personality before her mother died of breast cancer?   Answer: Madonna and her sisters noticed that their mother's behavior and personality had changed before her death. She became more distant and withdrawn, and her physical appearance changed as she became increasingly ill. She also became more emotional and would often cry.   Context: As they grew older Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: "We were all wounded in one way or another by [her death], and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died.

Answer: The natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay and is used for drinking water in the Miami metropolitan area is the Biscayne Aquifer.   Context: Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay, with its highest point peaking around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah. Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist.

Answer: Philadelphia has historically been a bastion of the Republican Party, but after the Great Depression, Democratic registrations increased and the city flipped to the Democrats in 1936. Since then, Philadelphia has remained loyally Democratic in every presidential election, with Barack Obama receiving 83% of the city's vote in 2008 and 85% in 2012.   Context: From the American Civil War until the mid-20th century, Philadelphia was a bastion of the Republican Party, which arose from the staunch pro-Northern views of Philadelphia residents during and after the war (Philadelphia was chosen as the host city for the first Republican National Convention in 1856). After the Great Depression, Democratic registrations increased, but the city was not carried by Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt in his landslide victory of 1932 (in which Pennsylvania was one of the few states won by Republican Herbert Hoover). Four years later, however, voter turnout surged and the city finally flipped to the Democrats. Roosevelt carried Philadelphia with over 60% of the vote in 1936. The city has remained loyally Democratic in every presidential election since. It is now one of the most Democratic in the country; in 2008, Democrat Barack Obama drew 83% of the city's vote.

Question: What is the significance of Bill Monroe in popularizing the mandolin in country music?   Answer: Bill Monroe is widely credited with popularizing the mandolin in country music. He was the first to transition the mandolin style from a "parlor" sound typical of brother duets to the modern "bluegrass" style. His joining the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South, directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin. His Gibson F-5 mandolin, signed and dated July 9, 1923, by Lloyd Loar, chief acoustic engineer at Gibson, has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders.   Context: When Cowan Powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926, his daughter Orpha Powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin. By the 1930s, single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music, most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys (Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers (Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe). However, the mandolin's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man: Bill Monroe, the father of bluegrass music. After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939, Bill Monroe formed his own group, after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys, and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a "parlor" sound typical of brother duets to the modern "bluegrass" style. He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South, directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin.

Question: What is the historical population makeup of Mexico City according to the 1921 census?   Answer: According to the 1921 census, the historical population makeup of Mexico City was 54.78% Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% European, and 18.74% Indigenous.   Context: Historically, and since pre-Hispanic times, the Valley of Anahuac has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico. When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's Cuauhtémoc borough. At the beginning of the 20th century, the elites began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San Ángel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous. This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify themselves with an heritage other than Amerindian. However, the census had the particularity that, unlike racial/ethnic census in other countries, it was focused in the perception of cultural heritage rather than in a racial perception, leading to a good number of white people to identify with "Mixed heritage" due cultural influence.

Question: What are the trade-offs involved in the design of data compression schemes?   Answer: The trade-offs involved in the design of data compression schemes include the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data. Additionally, when using lossy data compression, there is a trade-off between preserving information and reducing size.   Context: Compression is useful because it helps reduce resource usage, such as data storage space or transmission capacity. Because compressed data must be decompressed to use, this extra processing imposes computational or other costs through decompression; this situation is far from being a free lunch. Data compression is subject to a space–time complexity trade-off. For instance, a compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.

Question: What is the role of circadian rhythms in organisms' ability to anticipate and prepare for environmental changes, and how does this advantage them in evolutionary terms?   Answer: Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes by enabling them to best capitalize on environmental resources (e.g. light and food). This puts them at a selective advantage in evolutionary terms, as they are better able to survive and reproduce in their environment. Additionally, circadian rhythms are important in regulating and coordinating internal metabolic processes, which further helps organisms to survive and reproduce in their environment.   Context: Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes. They thus enable organisms to best capitalize on environmental resources (e.g. light and food) compared to those that cannot predict such availability. It has therefore been suggested that circadian rhythms put organisms at a selective advantage in evolutionary terms. However, rhythmicity appears to be as important in regulating and coordinating internal metabolic processes, as in coordinating with the environment. This is suggested by the maintenance (heritability) of circadian rhythms in fruit flies after several hundred generations in constant laboratory conditions, as well as in creatures in constant darkness in the wild, and by the experimental elimination of behavioral, but not physiological, circadian rhythms in quail.

Question: What is the hypothesis regarding plant growth and development being coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators?   Answer: The hypothesis is that plant growth and development is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators.   Context: The hypothesis that plant growth and development is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century. Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity, and concluded "It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle . . acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . . directing the several movements". About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.

In the second half of the 20th century, the high alpine meadows have ceased to be harvested for hay or used for grazing, which may eventually lead to a regrowth of forest. However, the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life cannot recover during the non-skiing months. Areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building are able to preserve the fragile underlayers.   Context: Human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas, and, except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps, forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries.

Question: What was the reason behind the high number of geniuses produced by Hungary during John von Neumann's generation, according to Eugene Wigner?   Answer: According to Eugene Wigner, the reason behind the high number of geniuses produced by Hungary during John von Neumann's generation was that von Neumann was the only genius.   Context: Von Neumann entered the Lutheran Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium in 1911. This was one of the best schools in Budapest, part of a brilliant education system designed for the elite. Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one gymnasium. Despite being run by the Lutheran Church, the majority of its pupils were Jewish. The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, that included Theodore von Kármán (b. 1881), George de Hevesy (b. 1885), Leó Szilárd (b. 1898), Eugene Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908), and Paul Erdős (b. 1913). Collectively, they were sometimes known as Martians. Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School. When asked why the Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses, Wigner, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, replied that von Neumann was the only genius.   Score: 0.888905585 
Question: What is the purpose of a protocol in international law and international relations?

Question: What factors contributed to Plymouth's decline as a trading port in the 17th century?   Answer: The factors that contributed to Plymouth's decline as a trading port in the 17th century were the cost of transporting commodities manufactured elsewhere in England, the lack of means to process sugar or tobacco imports, and the decline of locally produced wool as an export commodity.   Context: Throughout the 17th century Plymouth had gradually lost its pre-eminence as a trading port. By the mid-17th century commodities manufactured elsewhere in England cost too much to transport to Plymouth and the city had no means of processing sugar or tobacco imports, although it did play a relatively small part in the Atlantic slave trade during the early 18th century.

Question: What were the terms of the secret protocols in the proposed non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union?   Answer: The secret protocols of the proposed non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union divided territories of Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland into German and Soviet "spheres of influence", anticipating potential "territorial and political rearrangements" of these countries. Specifically, the protocols placed half of Poland (border along the Vistula river), Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Bessarabia in the Soviets' sphere of influence.   Context: The stated clauses of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact were a guarantee of non-belligerence by each party towards the other, and a written commitment that neither party would ally itself to, or aid, an enemy of the other party. In addition to stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland into German and Soviet "spheres of influence", anticipating potential "territorial and political rearrangements" of these countries. Thereafter, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. After the Soviet–Japanese ceasefire agreement took effect on 16 September, Stalin ordered his own invasion of Poland on 17 September. Part of southeastern (Karelia) and Salla region in Finland were annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War. This was followed by Soviet annexations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertza region). Concern about ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been proffered as justification for the Soviet invasion of Poland. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence agreed with the Axis.   Score: 0.897096217

Question: What types of anti-aircraft weapons did the British adopt in the 1930s and why were they considered superior for land use?   Answer: In the 1930s, the British adopted the Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun. This gun was considered superior for land use because it was powerful enough to knock down aircraft of any size, yet light enough to be mobile and easily swung. Additionally, the Imperial measurement production drawings developed by the British allowed for the Americans to produce their own copy of the 40 mm, which was a great advantage for the British war effort.   Context: During the 1930s solid fuel rockets were under development in the Soviet Union and Britain. In Britain the interest was for anti-aircraft fire, it quickly became clear that guidance would be required for precision. However, rockets, or 'unrotated projectiles' as they were called could the used for anti-aircraft barrages.

Question: What are the benefits of using pesticides in agriculture?   Answer: The benefits of using pesticides in agriculture include increased crop yield, the ability to grow a variety of crops throughout the year, the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses, and the creation of a large job market within the agrichemical sector. Additionally, pesticides can help to reduce the amount of money spent on crops, as every dollar spent on pesticides yields four dollars in crops saved.   Context: Every dollar ($1) that is spent on pesticides for crops yields four dollars ($4) in crops saved. This means based that, on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides, $10 billion, there is an additional $40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds. In general, farmers benefit from having an increase in crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year. Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year-round.

Question: What is the composition of soda-lime glass and why are other substances added to it during processing?   Answer: Soda-lime glass is composed of about 70 to 74% silica (SiO2) by weight, with the remainder being sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), lime (calcium oxide [CaO]), magnesium oxide (MgO), and aluminium oxide (Al2O3). Other substances are added to simplify processing, as the high melting-temperature (1723 °C) and viscosity of pure silica make it difficult to work with. The soda lowers the glass transition temperature, but also makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable. The addition of lime, magnesium oxide, and aluminium oxide provide for better chemical durability.   Context: Following the glass batch preparation and mixing, the raw materials are transported to the furnace. Soda-lime glass for mass production is melted in gas fired units. Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks. After melting, homogenization and refining (removal of bubbles), the glass is formed. Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish. Container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods. This glass is often slightly modified chemically (with more alumina and calcium oxide) for greater water resistance.

Answer: The topic of the text is incubation in birds, and it provides information about brood parasitism among birds, including how it works, which species are obligate parasites, and how the parasitic chicks are adapted to survive. It also provides information about the incubation process, including how it is shared in monogamous species, how warmth is passed to the eggs, and the range of incubation periods.   Context: Brood parasitism, in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism. After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.

Question: What was the armaments agreement between Nasser and Czechoslovakia and how did it affect the balance of power between Egypt and Israel?   Answer: The armaments agreement between Nasser and Czechoslovakia was a US$320,000,000 agreement concluded on 27 September. This agreement allowed Nasser to acquire modern weaponry to arm his military, which more or less equalized the balance of power between Egypt and Israel. This agreement also enhanced Nasser's role as the Arab leader defying the West.   Context: Simultaneous with Israel's February raid, the Baghdad Pact was formed between some regional allies of the UK. Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact a threat to his efforts to eliminate British military influence in the Middle East, and a mechanism to undermine the Arab League and "perpetuate [Arab] subservience to Zionism and [Western] imperialism". Nasser felt that if he was to maintain Egypt's regional leadership position he needed to acquire modern weaponry to arm his military. When it became apparent to him that Western countries would not supply Egypt under acceptable financial and military terms, Nasser turned to the Eastern Bloc and concluded a US$320,000,000 armaments agreement with Czechoslovakia on 27 September.

Answer: The Treaty of Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories, as well as for assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic. This brought the Revolutionary Wars to an end and allowed for a period of peace and economic recovery in Europe. As a result, Napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate, both domestically and abroad. This led to a new plebiscite in the spring of 1802, in which the French public overwhelmingly approved a constitution that made the Consulate permanent and essentially elevated Napoleon to dictator for life.   Context: After a decade of constant warfare, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories as well as for assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic. With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate, both domestically and abroad. In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Napoleon to dictator for life. Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people to the polls, the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote (72% of all eligible voters). There was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime; the constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote. His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution: Article 1. The French people name, and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life. After 1802, he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte.   Score: 0.894164503

Question: What is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom and what are the terms used for hunting in other countries?   Answer: The type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom is unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds. In other countries, what is called "hunting" is referred to as "shooting" (birds) or "stalking" (deer).   Context: Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom; in fact, "hunting" without qualification implies fox hunting. What in other countries is called "hunting" is called "shooting" (birds) or "stalking" (deer) in Britain. Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock, fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds. Pairs of Sight hounds (or long-dogs), such as greyhounds, may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers. Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags (deer) or mink. Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.   Score: 0.879903913 
Question: What are the reasons for major FBS teams scheduling early season non-conference preseason home games against lower-tier opponents?   Answer: The reasons for major FBS teams scheduling early season non-conference preseason home games against lower-tier opponents are primarily financial. These games provide a large appearance fee and at least one guaranteed television appearance for the smaller school, and they also provide an opportunity for the FBS team to run up the score against a weak opponent. Additionally, these games do not count toward the minimum seven wins required for bowl eligibility, and only one game against an FCS team can be counted.   Context: However, most of the major FBS teams annually schedule early season non-conference preseason home games against lesser opponents that are lower-tier FBS, Football Championship, or Division II schools, which often result in lopsided victories in favor of the FBS teams and act as exhibition games in all but name, though they additionally provide a large appearance fee and at least one guaranteed television appearance for the smaller school. These games also receive the same criticism as NFL exhibition games, but instead it is targeted to schools scheduling low-quality opponents and the simplicity for a team to run up the score against a weak opponent. However, these games are susceptible to backfiring, resulting in damage in poll position and public perception, especially if the higher ranked team loses, although the mere act of scheduling a weak opponent is harmful to a team's overall strength of schedule itself. Games an FBS team schedules against lower division opponents do not count toward the minimum seven wins required for bowl eligibility, and only one game against an FCS team can be counted. With the start of the College Football Playoff system for the 2014 season, major teams are now discouraged from scheduling weaker opponents for their non-conference schedule because of a much higher emphasis on strength of schedule than in the Bowl Championship Series era.

Question: What is the current status of Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people and what languages are commonly spoken among Jews worldwide?   Answer: The current status of Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people is that it is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide. English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora, and the three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel.   Context: Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although communities in North Africa today are small and dwindling, Jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one (or nearly so), speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and the city of Tunis, while most North Africans continue to use Arabic as their mother tongue.[citation needed]   Score: 0.880305052

Question: What is the history and significance of the capacitor invention by Ewald Georg von Kleist and Pieter van Musschenbroek?   Answer: The invention of the capacitor by Ewald Georg von Kleist and Pieter van Musschenbroek was a major breakthrough in the field of electricity. In October 1745, von Kleist discovered that charge could be stored by connecting a high-voltage electrostatic generator to a volume of water in a hand-held glass jar. His hand and the water acted as conductors, and the jar as a dielectric. When he touched the wire, he was shocked by a powerful spark. The following year, van Musschenbroek invented a similar capacitor, which was named the Leyden jar after the University of Leiden where he worked. He was also impressed by the power of the shock he received, writing, "I would not take a second shock for the kingdom of France." This invention of the capacitor was significant because it allowed for the storage of electrical charge, which was a major step forward in the development of electricity.   Context: In October 1745, Ewald Georg von Kleist of Pomerania, Germany, found that charge could be stored by connecting a high-voltage electrostatic generator by a wire to a volume of water in a hand-held glass jar. Von Kleist's hand and the water acted as conductors, and the jar as a dielectric (although details of the mechanism were incorrectly identified at the time). Von Kleist found that touching the wire resulted in a powerful spark, much more painful than that obtained from an electrostatic machine.

Question: What is the purpose of audio data compression and how does it reduce transmission bandwidth and storage requirements?   Answer: The purpose of audio data compression is to reduce the transmission bandwidth and storage requirements of audio data by using lossy audio compression algorithms. These algorithms use psychoacoustics to eliminate less audible or meaningful sounds, thereby reducing the space required to store or transmit them. This allows for higher compression at the cost of fidelity, making it possible to reduce the amount of data needed to store or transmit audio data.   Context: Audio data compression, not to be confused with dynamic range compression, has the potential to reduce the transmission bandwidth and storage requirements of audio data. Audio compression algorithms are implemented in software as audio codecs. Lossy audio compression algorithms provide higher compression at the cost of fidelity and are used in numerous audio applications.

Question: What is the historical significance of Boston's renaming and its early European settlers?   Answer: Boston's renaming and its early European settlers are historically significant because they marked the beginning of the city's settlement by Puritan colonists from England. The renaming of the area from Trimountaine to Boston on September 7, 1630 was a symbolic gesture of the colonists' commitment to their new home. The settlers' arrival also marked the start of the city's long history of being a major port and manufacturing hub, as well as a center for education and culture.

Question: What are the characteristics and limitations of electrolytic capacitors?   Answer: Electrolytic capacitors offer very high capacitance but suffer from poor tolerances, high instability, gradual loss of capacitance especially when subjected to heat, and high leakage current. Poor quality capacitors may leak electrolyte, which is harmful to printed circuit boards. The conductivity of the electrolyte drops at low temperatures, which increases equivalent series resistance. While widely used for power-supply conditioning, poor high-frequency characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications. Electrolytic capacitors will self-degrade if unused for a period (around a year), and when full power is applied may short circuit, permanently damaging the capacitor and usually blowing a fuse or causing failure of rectifier diodes (for instance, in older equipment, arcing in rectifier tubes). They can be restored before use (and damage) by gradually applying the operating voltage, often done on antique vacuum tube equipment over a period of 30 minutes by using a variable transformer to supply AC power. Unfortunately, the use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment, which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range, requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits. Such remedies may not be applicable to modern high-frequency power supplies as these produce full output voltage even with reduced input.

Question: What is the importance of hunting in managing populations that may exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species, according to resource managers?   Answer: According to resource managers, hunting is an important tool in managing populations that may exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species. Hunting advocates assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter, reducing mortality among the remaining animals. However, in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability, and hunting for 'population control' has no effect on the annual population of species. In some cases, it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established, resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area, thus artificially increasing the population.

Question: What is the role of County Sheriff's Offices and Municipal Police Departments in Tennessee's local law enforcement?   Answer: The role of County Sheriff's Offices and Municipal Police Departments in Tennessee's local law enforcement is to provide warrant service, court security, jail operations, primary law enforcement in the unincorporated areas of a county, and support to the municipal police departments. The Sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in the county and has jurisdiction over the county as a whole. Incorporated municipalities are required to maintain a police department to provide police services within their corporate limits.   Context: Local law enforcement is divided between County Sheriff's Offices and Municipal Police Departments. Tennessee's Constitution requires that each County have an elected Sheriff. In 94 of the 95 counties the Sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in the county and has jurisdiction over the county as a whole. Each Sheriff's Office is responsible for warrant service, court security, jail operations and primary law enforcement in the unincorporated areas of a county as well as providing support to the municipal police departments. Incorporated municipalities are required to maintain a police department to provide police services within their corporate limits.   Score: 0.925656199 
Question: What is the process of raising broiler chickens intensively for their meat?   Answer: The process of raising broiler chickens intensively for their meat involves growing them to an acceptable carcass size in six weeks or less. They are then hung by their feet, stunned, killed, bled, scalded, plucked, have their heads and feet removed, eviscerated, washed, chilled, drained, weighed, and packed, all within the course of little over two hours. Male birds are often castrated to prevent aggression and produce more tender and flavorful meat.   Context: Chickens raised intensively for their meat are known as "broilers". Breeds have been developed that can grow to an acceptable carcass size (2 kg (4.4 lb)) in six weeks or less. Broilers grow so fast, their legs cannot always support their weight and their hearts and respiratory systems may not be able to supply enough oxygen to their developing muscles. Mortality rates at 1% are much higher than for less-intensively reared laying birds which take 18 weeks to reach similar weights. Processing the birds is done automatically with conveyor-belt efficiency. They are hung by their feet, stunned, killed, bled, scalded, plucked, have their heads and feet removed, eviscerated, washed, chilled, drained, weighed, and packed, all within the course of little over two hours.

Question: What was John's nickname given to him by his father during his early years?   Answer: John's nickname given to him by his father during his early years was "Lackland".   Context: John grew up to be around 5 ft 5 in (1.68 m) tall, relatively short, with a "powerful, barrel-chested body" and dark red hair; he looked to contemporaries like an inhabitant of Poitou. John enjoyed reading and, unusually for the period, built up a travelling library of books. He enjoyed gambling, in particular at backgammon, and was an enthusiastic hunter, even by medieval standards. He liked music, although not songs. John would become a "connoisseur of jewels", building up a large collection, and became famous for his opulent clothes and also, according to French chroniclers, for his fondness for bad wine. As John grew up, he became known for sometimes being "genial, witty, generous and hospitable"; at other moments, he could be jealous, over-sensitive and prone to fits of rage, "biting and gnawing his fingers" in anger.[nb 3]   Score: 0.841587484 
Question: What actions were taken by the government of St. Helena in 2012 to promote human rights?   Answer: In 2012, the government of St. Helena funded the creation of the St. Helena Human Rights Action Plan 2012-2015. Actions taken under this action plan included publishing awareness-raising articles in local newspapers, providing support for members of the public with human rights queries, and extending several UN Conventions on human rights to St. Helena.   Context: In 2012, the government of St. Helena funded the creation of the St. Helena Human Rights Action Plan 2012-2015.

Question: What is electroluminescence and how does it relate to the emission of light from a P-N junction in a light-emitting diode?   Answer: Electroluminescence is the emission of light from a semi-conductor under the influence of an electric field. In a light-emitting diode, a P-N junction is used to convert absorbed light energy into a proportional electric current. When electrical energy is applied to the P-N junction, the charge carriers recombine in a forward-biased P-N junction as the electrons cross from the N-region and recombine with the holes existing in the P-region. This process releases energy in the form of heat and light, which is known as electroluminescence.   Context: A P-N junction can convert absorbed light energy into a proportional electric current. The same process is reversed here (i.e. the P-N junction emits light when electrical energy is applied to it). This phenomenon is generally called electroluminescence, which can be defined as the emission of light from a semi-conductor under the influence of an electric field. The charge carriers recombine in a forward-biased P-N junction as the electrons cross from the N-region and recombine with the holes existing in the P-region. Free electrons are in the conduction band of energy levels, while holes are in the valence energy band. Thus the energy level of the holes will be lesser than the energy levels of the electrons. Some portion of the energy must be dissipated in order to recombine the electrons and the holes. This energy is emitted in the form of heat and light.   Score: 0.917604506

Context: At the end of World War II Soviet troops occupied southern Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, making them part of the RSFSR. The status of the southernmost Kurils remains in dispute with Japan.   Score: 0.872543931 
Question: What is the significance of the Potala Palace in Tibetan architecture?   Answer: The Potala Palace is the most important example of Tibetan architecture, as it was the former residence of the Dalai Lama and contains over one thousand rooms within thirteen stories. It houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha, and is divided between the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines, and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures. The Potala Palace is also a World Heritage Site, making it a significant symbol of Tibetan culture and history.   Context: Standing at 117 metres (384 feet) in height and 360 metres (1,180 feet) in width, the Potala Palace is the most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the Dalai Lama, it contains over one thousand rooms within thirteen stories, and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided between the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines, and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures.
