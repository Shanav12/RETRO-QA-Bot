Question: What are the four conditions, known as the group axioms, that an operation in a mathematical group must satisfy?   Answer: The four conditions, known as the group axioms, that an operation in a mathematical group must satisfy are: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.   Context: In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element. The operation satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely. It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.   Score: 0.864092946 
Question: What are some adaptations in the gait of insects that allow them to maintain stability and navigate different terrains?   Answer: Insects can adapt their gait to maintain stability and navigate different terrains in a variety of ways. For example, when moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. This allows the insect to maintain a stable stance and navigate different terrains. Additionally, insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs. This allows them to maintain stability and continue to move forward. Finally, the tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance. This gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds and allows them to navigate different terrains quickly and efficiently.   Context: Many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in cockroaches. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.

Question: How did the construction of highways and freeways in Detroit contribute to the phenomenon of suburbanization in the postwar era?   Answer: The construction of highways and freeways in Detroit made commuting by car easier, which encouraged people to move out of the city and into the suburbs. This increased the demand for new housing in the suburbs, which in turn stimulated suburbanization in the postwar era.   Context: As in other major American cities in the postwar era, construction of an extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used electric streetcar line along the length of Woodward Avenue was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds.   Score: 0.89738369 
Question: How did the Greek colony of Massalia in pre-Roman Gaul contribute to the spread of Greek culture and language in southern Gaul during the Hellenistic period?   Answer: The Greek colony of Massalia in pre-Roman Gaul contributed to the spread of Greek culture and language in southern Gaul during the Hellenistic period by minting coins with Greek designs and letters, trading with the inland regions of France, and serving as a center of education where Celts went to learn Greek.   Context: Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul were mostly limited to the Mediterranean coast of Provence. The first Greek colony in the region was Massalia, which became one of the largest trading ports of Mediterranean by the 4th century BCE with 6,000 inhabitants. Massalia was also the local hegemon, controlling various coastal Greek cities like Nice and Agde. The coins minted in Massalia have been found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Celtic coinage was influenced by Greek designs, and Greek letters can be found on various Celtic coins, especially those of Southern France. Traders from Massalia ventured inland deep into France on the Rivers Durance and Rhône, and established overland trade routes deep into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy. The Hellenistic period saw the Greek alphabet spread into southern Gaul from Massalia (3rd and 2nd centuries BCE) and according to Strabo, Massalia was also a center of education, where Celts went to learn Greek. A staunch ally of Rome, Massalia retained its independence until it sided with Pompey in 49 BCE and was then taken by Caesar's forces.   Score: 0.919708788 
Question: What were the factors that led to the evolution and development of samurai armor over the centuries?   Answer: The factors that led to the evolution and development of samurai armor over the centuries were the advent of firearms, new fighting tactics, and the need for additional protection. The introduction of firearms necessitated the need for more protective armor, which led to the development of plate armor, or Tosei-gusoku. This armor was made from iron plated dou (dō) and was designed to provide more protection than the traditional kozane dou made from individual scales. As the methods of samurai warfare changed over the centuries, samurai armor also changed and developed to meet the new needs of the samurai.   Context: In the 1500s a new type of armor started to become popular due to the advent of firearms, new fighting tactics and the need for additional protection. The kozane dou made from individual scales was replaced by plate armor. This new armor, which used iron plated dou (dō), was referred to as Tosei-gusoku, or modern armor. Various other components of armor protected the samurai's body. The helmet kabuto was an important part of the samurai's armor. Samurai armor changed and developed as the methods of samurai warfare changed over the centuries. The known last use of samurai armor occurring in 1877 during the satsuma rebellion.

Question: What are the characteristics and implications of synnecrosis, a rare type of symbiosis where the interaction between species is detrimental to both organisms involved?   Answer: Synnecrosis is a rare type of symbiosis in which the interaction between species is detrimental to both organisms involved. It is a short-lived condition, as the interaction eventually causes death. This means that the organisms involved will not benefit from the interaction, and instead will suffer from it. Evolution selects against synnecrosis, as it is not beneficial for either organism, and it is uncommon in nature. An example of this is the relationship between some species of bees and victims of the bee sting.

Question: What challenges does the presence of the Biscayne Aquifer pose for underground construction in the Miami metropolitan area?   Answer: The presence of the Biscayne Aquifer poses the challenge of not being able to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction. This means that any underground construction in the Miami metropolitan area must be done with caution and consideration of the aquifer.   Context: Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay, with its highest point peaking around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah. Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist.

Question: What are some potential misconceptions about child labour and how can they affect our understanding of its impact on children?   Answer: One potential misconception about child labour is that it is a necessary evil and that it is the only way for children to make money. This misconception can lead to a lack of understanding of the negative impacts of child labour, such as the exploitation of children, the lack of access to education, and the potential for physical and psychological harm. Another misconception is that child labour is only a problem in developing countries, when in fact it is a global issue. This misconception can lead to a lack of understanding of the need for global solutions to address the issue. Finally, another misconception is that child labour is only a problem in certain industries, when in fact it is a problem in many industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services. This misconception can lead to a lack of understanding of the need for comprehensive solutions to address the issue.   Context: Lack of meaningful alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to ILO, is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work because they have nothing better to do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60–70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or the quality of education is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.

Question: What impact did W. H. Russell's dispatches from the Crimean War have on the coverage of conflicts by newspapers?   Answer: W. H. Russell's dispatches from the Crimean War had a significant impact on the coverage of conflicts by newspapers. His reports provided detailed accounts of the day-to-day realities of the war, which kept the public of the nations involved better informed than ever before. This increased public interest in the war and energised public opinion, which ultimately led to changes in government. As a result, newspapers began to send war correspondents to cover particular conflicts, setting a precedent for future wars.   Context: Notable documentation of the war was provided by William Howard Russell (writing for The Times newspaper) and the photographs of Roger Fenton.:306–309 News from war correspondents reached all nations involved in the war and kept the public citizenry of those nations better informed of the day-to-day events of the war than had been the case in any other war to that date. The British public was very well informed regarding the day-to-day realities of the war in the Crimea. After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea during the winter of 1854, the news reached London in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours.

Question: What were the reasons for San Diego becoming a major hub of military and defense activity during World War II?   Answer: The reasons for San Diego becoming a major hub of military and defense activity during World War II were due to the presence of numerous military installations and defense manufacturers in the city. San Diego was home to several major naval bases, including the Naval Training Center San Diego, the Naval Air Station North Island, and the Naval Air Station San Diego. Additionally, the city was home to several defense manufacturers, such as Consolidated Aircraft Corporation, Rohr Aircraft Corporation, and Ryan Aeronautical Company. These military installations and defense manufacturers provided the necessary resources and personnel to support the war effort, making San Diego an important hub of military and defense activity.   Context: During World War II, San Diego became a major hub of military and defense activity, due to the presence of so many military installations and defense manufacturers. The city's population grew rapidly during and after World War II, more than doubling between 1930 (147,995) and 1950 (333,865). During the final months of the war, the Japanese had a plan to target multiple U.S. cities for biological attack, starting with San Diego. The plan was called "Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night" and called for kamikaze planes filled with fleas infected with plague (Yersinia pestis) to crash into civilian population centers in the city, hoping to spread plague in the city and effectively kill tens of thousands of civilians. The plan was scheduled to launch on September 22, 1945, but was not carried out because Japan surrendered five weeks earlier.   Score: 0.913777947 
Question: What are the main arguments presented by Hegel and Berkeley that challenge the concept of materialism?   Answer: Hegel and Berkeley both argue that matter is redundant and that mind-independent properties can be reduced to subjective percepts. Berkeley further argues that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external. As such, the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent (perceived) stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience.   Context: An argument for idealism, such as those of Hegel and Berkeley, is ipso facto an argument against materialism. Matter can be argued to be redundant, as in bundle theory, and mind-independent properties can in turn be reduced to subjective percepts. Berkeley presents an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external. As such, the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent (perceived) stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience.   Score: 0.897112 
Question: What are the factors that contribute to Houston's historically ample amount of rainfall and localized flooding?   Answer: Houston's historically ample amount of rainfall and localized flooding is largely due to its location in the Gulf Coast region, which is prone to tropical storms and hurricanes. The city's proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and its low-lying terrain also contribute to the amount of rainfall and localized flooding. Additionally, the city's numerous bayous and creeks, which are used to drain the city's stormwater, can become overwhelmed during heavy rain events, leading to localized flooding.   Context: The Houston area has over 150 active faults (estimated to be 300 active faults) with an aggregate length of up to 310 miles (500 km), including the Long Point–Eureka Heights fault system which runs through the center of the city. There have been no significant historically recorded earthquakes in Houston, but researchers do not discount the possibility of such quakes having occurred in the deeper past, nor occurring in the future. Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years. It may be associated with slip along the faults; however, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves. These faults also tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed "fault creep", which further reduces the risk of an earthquake.   Score: 0.815048

Question: How has the Church Educational System Honor Code at Brigham Young University evolved over time and what impact has it had on the student and faculty community?   Answer: The Church Educational System Honor Code at Brigham Young University has evolved over time to include more standards and regulations. Initially, the Honor Code was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. However, President Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards such as chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. This has had a significant impact on the student and faculty community, as all students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to the Honor Code. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process, and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In certain cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure. Various LGBT advocacy groups have protested the honor code and criticized it as being anti-gay, and The Princeton Review ranked BYU as the 3rd most LGBT-unfriendly school in the United States.   Context: All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to an honor code. Early forms of the Church Educational System Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy and early school President Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the "Domestic Organization", which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Honor Code itself was not created until about 1940, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. President Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards. This led to what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol.

Question: What factors contribute to the variability of summer rains in the South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion?   Answer: The factors that contribute to the variability of summer rains in the South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion are the movements of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the year-to-year fluctuations in rainfall. The ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that moves north and south with the seasons, bringing summer rains to the region during July and August. However, the amount of rainfall can vary greatly from year to year, making it difficult to predict the exact amount of rainfall for any given year.   Context: The South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion is a narrow band running east and west between the hyper-arid Sahara and the Sahel savannas to the south. Movements of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) bring summer rains during July and August which average 100 to 200 mm (3.9 to 7.9 in) but vary greatly from year to year.

Question: What are the differences between ROM and RAM in terms of their functionality and how they store data in a computer system?   Answer: The main difference between ROM and RAM is their functionality and how they store data in a computer system. ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, so the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In contrast, RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it. The contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.   Context: RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software.

Question: What are the main differences between the cell walls of bacteria, plants, fungi, and Archaea, and how does the composition of bacterial cell walls contribute to their survival?   Answer: The main differences between the cell walls of bacteria, plants, fungi, and Archaea are the materials used to construct them. Bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan, which is composed of polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. Plant cell walls are made of cellulose, while fungal cell walls are made of chitin. Archaea do not contain peptidoglycan in their cell walls. The composition of bacterial cell walls contributes to their survival by providing them with a protective barrier against environmental stressors. The peptidoglycan layer also helps to maintain the shape of the cell and prevents it from bursting due to osmotic pressure. Additionally, the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan, which further demonstrates the importance of this material in bacterial survival.   Context: In most bacteria, a cell wall is present on the outside of the cell membrane. The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope. A common bacterial cell wall material is peptidoglycan (called "murein" in older sources), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan.

Question: What were the reasons behind the development of a political movement in the United States in the 1890s to mandate private executions and exclude public view?   Answer: The reasons behind the development of a political movement in the United States in the 1890s to mandate private executions and exclude public view were largely rooted in the idea of protecting the public from the gruesome nature of executions. This movement was also driven by a desire to limit the potential for public disorder and unrest that could be caused by public executions. Additionally, some states wanted to limit the potential for public criticism of the death penalty, as well as the potential for public sympathy for the condemned.   Context: Around 1890, a political movement developed in the United States to mandate private executions. Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a "wall" or "enclosure" to "exclude public view." For example, in 1919, the Missouri legislature adopted a statute (L.1919, p. 781) which required, "the sentence of death should be executed within the county jail, if convenient, and otherwise within an enclosure near the jail." The Missouri law permitted the local sheriff to distribute passes to individuals (usually local citizens) whom he believed should witness the hanging, but the sheriffs – for various reasons – sometimes denied passes to individuals who wanted to watch. Missouri executions conducted after 1919 were not "public" because they were conducted behind closed walls, and the general public was not permitted to attend.   Score: 0.889434516 
Question: What were the economic implications of the British Empire's involvement in the slave trade and how did it contribute to the growth of certain British cities?   Answer: The British Empire's involvement in the slave trade had significant economic implications. The slave trade was extremely profitable for the slave traders, and it became a major economic mainstay for western British cities such as Bristol and Liverpool. These cities formed the third corner of the so-called triangular trade with Africa and the Americas, and the profits from the slave trade helped to fuel their growth. The slave trade also contributed to the growth of the British colonies in the Caribbean, as the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25 percent in 1650 to around 80 percent in 1780.   Context: Two years later, the Royal African Company was inaugurated, receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean. From the outset, slavery was the basis of the British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic. To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as James Island, Accra and Bunce Island. In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25 percent in 1650 to around 80 percent in 1780, and in the 13 Colonies from 10 percent to 40 percent over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies). For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol and Liverpool, which formed the third corner of the so-called triangular trade with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the Middle Passage was one in seven.   Score: 0.873705328 
Question: What are some structural concepts that need to be employed to understand groups beyond mere symbolic manipulations?   Answer: Some structural concepts that need to be employed to understand groups beyond mere symbolic manipulations include group homomorphisms, subgroups, quotient groups, and category theory. Group homomorphisms are functions that respect the group structure in a precise sense. Subgroups and quotient groups are pieces of a group that can be used to understand its structure. Category theory is a recurring topic in mathematics that is used to preserve structures, in this case the category of groups.   Context: To understand groups beyond the level of mere symbolic manipulations as above, more structural concepts have to be employed.c[›] There is a conceptual principle underlying all of the following notions: to take advantage of the structure offered by groups (which sets, being "structureless", do not have), constructions related to groups have to be compatible with the group operation. This compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways. For example, groups can be related to each other via functions called group homomorphisms. By the mentioned principle, they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense. The structure of groups can also be understood by breaking them into pieces called subgroups and quotient groups. The principle of "preserving structures"—a recurring topic in mathematics throughout—is an instance of working in a category, in this case the category of groups.   Score: 0.888621509 
Question: What were the consequences of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922 on the Greek population in Asia Minor and how did it contribute to the Greek exodus from the region?   Answer: The Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922 had devastating consequences for the Greek population in Asia Minor. The war resulted in a massive flight of Asia Minor Greeks, as the Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Greeks during the Greek genocide (1914-1922). This led to an official Population exchange between Greece and Turkey, which was part of the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne that ended the war. This exchange made the Greek exodus from Asia Minor permanent and expanded it, as many Greeks were forced to leave the region.   Context: In the aftermath of the First World War, Greece attempted further expansion into Asia Minor, a region with a large native Greek population at the time, but was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, contributing to a massive flight of Asia Minor Greeks. These events overlapped, with both happening during the Greek genocide (1914-1922), a period during which, according to various sources, Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks. The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Question: What are the consequences for not paying the disposal fee for household rubbish in Switzerland?   Answer: The consequences for not paying the disposal fee for household rubbish in Switzerland are fines ranging from CHF 200–500.   Context: In many places in Switzerland, household rubbish disposal is charged for. Rubbish (except dangerous items, batteries etc.) is only collected if it is in bags which either have a payment sticker attached, or in official bags with the surcharge paid at the time of purchase. This gives a financial incentive to recycle as much as possible, since recycling is free. Illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful disposal of larger volumes at traffic intersections and public areas.

Question: What was Burke's perspective on the Government's response to the uprising and how did he express it in his published work?   Answer: Burke believed the Government was not taking the uprising seriously enough and he expressed this view in his published work, Remarks on the Policy of the Allies with Respect to France. He argued that "in this war with France, one Frenchman is worth twenty foreigners" and that the La Vendée uprising was a proof of this. He also wrote that the English national character was being changed by the authoritarianism of the Lord North administration and that the people of England were becoming less eager, inquisitive, jealous, and fiery.   Context: Burke believed the Government was not taking the uprising seriously enough, a view reinforced by a letter he had received from the Prince Charles of France (S.A.R. le comte d'Artois), dated 23 October, requesting that he intercede on behalf of the royalists to the Government. Burke was forced to reply on 6 November: "I am not in His Majesty's Service; or at all consulted in his Affairs".

Question: What factors contributed to the rise of the Maratha suzerainty during the post-Mughal era in India?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the rise of the Maratha suzerainty during the post-Mughal era in India include the emergence of small regional states, the increasing activities of European powers, the leadership of Chatrapati Shivaji, and the efforts of Peshwa Bajirao I. Shivaji was determined to establish Hindavi Swarajya and is credited with founding and consolidating the Maratha kingdom. Bajirao I is credited with making the Marathas a formidable power nationally.   Context: The post-Mughal era was dominated by the rise of the Maratha suzerainty as other small regional states (mostly late Mughal tributary states) emerged, and also by the increasing activities of European powers. There is no doubt that the single most important power to emerge in the long twilight of the Mughal dynasty was the Maratha confederacy. The Maratha kingdom was founded and consolidated by Chatrapati Shivaji, a Maratha aristocrat of the Bhonsle clan who was determined to establish Hindavi Swarajya. Sir J.N. Sarkar described Shivaji as "the last great constructive genius and nation builder that the Hindu race has produced".

Question: What are some significant contributions of the Sumerians in the fields of writing, astronomy, and technology?   Answer: In the field of writing, the Sumerians are credited with the invention of cuneiform, a system of writing that used wedge-shaped reeds to write on moist clay. This system of writing was used to create historical records, literature, laws, hymns, prayers, stories, and daily records. In the field of astronomy, the Sumerians are credited with the invention of the sexagesimal system, a system of counting and measuring time based on the number 60. This system was used to measure the length of the day, the month, and the year. In the field of technology, the Sumerians are credited with the invention of the wheel, the sailboat, and the plow. They also developed irrigation systems and built large cities with complex systems of government.   Context: The most important archaeological discoveries in Sumer are a large number of tablets written in cuneiform. Sumerian writing, while proven to be not the oldest example of writing on earth, is considered to be a great milestone in the development of man's ability to not only create historical records but also in creating pieces of literature both in the form of poetic epics and stories as well as prayers and laws. Although pictures — that is, hieroglyphs — were first used, cuneiform and then Ideograms (where symbols were made to represent ideas) soon followed. Triangular or wedge-shaped reeds were used to write on moist clay. A large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the Sumerian language have survived, such as personal or business letters, receipts, lexical lists, laws, hymns, prayers, stories, daily records, and even libraries full of clay tablets. Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects like statues or bricks are also very common. Many texts survive in multiple copies because they were repeatedly transcribed by scribes-in-training. Sumerian continued to be the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after Semitic speakers had become dominant.   Score: 0.891077161 
Question: How has the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and the former entities of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands impacted Guam in terms of public assistance programs and education for migrants from the regions involved?   Answer: The Compacts of Free Association between the United States and the former entities of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands have had a significant impact on Guam in terms of public assistance programs and education for migrants from the regions involved. It has been claimed by some in Guam that the territory has had to bear the brunt of this agreement in the form of public assistance programs and public education for those from the regions involved, and the federal government should compensate the states and territories affected by this type of migration. Congress has appropriated "Compact Impact" aids to Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and Hawaii, and this appropriation was written into each renewed Compact. However, some continue to claim the compensation is not enough or that the distribution of actual compensation received is significantly disproportionate.   Context: The Compacts of Free Association between the United States, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau accorded the former entities of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands a political status of "free association" with the United States. The Compacts give citizens of these island nations generally no restrictions to reside in the United States (also its territories), and many were attracted to Guam due to its proximity, environmental, and cultural familiarity.

Question: How has Unicode's encoding of characters rather than glyphs impacted the processing of ancient Japanese and uncommon Japanese names, and what attempts have been made to address this issue?   Answer: Unicode's encoding of characters rather than glyphs has complicated the processing of ancient Japanese and uncommon Japanese names, as the unification of glyphs leads to the perception that the languages themselves, not just the basic character representation, are being merged. To address this issue, there have been several attempts to create alternative encodings that preserve the stylistic differences between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters in opposition to Unicode's policy of Han unification. An example of one is TRON, which is favored by some users who need to handle historical Japanese text. Additionally, the surrogate character mechanism implemented in Unicode 2.0 increased the Unicode codespace to over a million code points, allowing for the encoding of many historic scripts and thousands of rarely used or obsolete characters that had not been anticipated as needing encoding.   Context: Unicode has been criticized for failing to separately encode older and alternative forms of kanji which, critics argue, complicates the processing of ancient Japanese and uncommon Japanese names. This is often due to the fact that Unicode encodes characters rather than glyphs (the visual representations of the basic character that often vary from one language to another).

Question: How does the prevalence of Arabic loanwords in Spanish compare to Catalan, and what factors might contribute to this difference?   Answer: The prevalence of Arabic loanwords in Spanish is generally much more prevalent than in Catalan.

Question: What are the key differences between the cellular theory and the humoral theory of immunity in immunology?   Answer: The key differences between the cellular theory and the humoral theory of immunity in immunology are that the cellular theory states that phagocytes are responsible for immune responses, while the humoral theory states that the active immune agents are soluble components found in the organism’s “humors”.   Context: Immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude. Many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time. The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between "cellular" and "humoral" theories of immunity. According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff, it was cells – more precisely, phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses. In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, among others, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism’s “humors” rather than its cells.

In the United States, the introduction of primaries and other reforms has transformed the party systems so that power is held by activists who compete over influence and nomination of candidates. This has shifted the party systems from cadre parties to hybrid parties, which are a combination of cadre and mass parties.   Context: French political scientist Maurice Duverger drew a distinction between cadre parties and mass parties. Cadre parties were political elites that were concerned with contesting elections and restricted the influence of outsiders, who were only required to assist in election campaigns. Mass parties tried to recruit new members who were a source of party income and were often expected to spread party ideology as well as assist in elections.Socialist parties are examples of mass parties, while the British Conservative Party and the German Christian Democratic Union are examples of hybrid parties.

Question: What were the reasons behind the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church during the Protestant Reformation?   Answer: The primary reason behind the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church during the Protestant Reformation was the political necessity of King Henry VIII. Henry VIII wanted to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome and declared himself the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England in 1534 with the Act of Supremacy. This was followed by the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries between 1535 and 1540. Additionally, some Christians were not content with the achievements of the mainstream Protestant Reformation and were disappointed that the Church of England had not made corrections of what some considered to be errors and abuses.   Context: The political separation of the Church of England from Rome under Henry VIII brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement. Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (via media) between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. The English Reformation followed a particular course. The different character of the English Reformation came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII. King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England. Between 1535 and 1540, under Thomas Cromwell, the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I, a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I. The Elizabethan Religious Settlement largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other. It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century.   Score: 0.886771381 
Question: How did the actions of Russian-backed Ukrainian Haidamaks in Balta contribute to the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774 and the subsequent Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca?   Answer: The actions of the Russian-backed Ukrainian Haidamaks in Balta provoked the Ottoman Empire into the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. The massacre of the citizens and burning of the town to the ground was seen as an act of aggression by the Ottoman Empire, and they responded by declaring war on Russia. The war ended with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, which provided freedom to worship for the Christian citizens of the Ottoman-controlled provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia.   Context: In 1768 Russian-backed Ukrainian Haidamaks, pursuing Polish confederates, entered Balta, an Ottoman-controlled town on the border of Bessarabia in Ukraine, and massacred its citizens and burned the town to the ground. This action provoked the Ottoman Empire into the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca of 1774 ended the war and provided freedom to worship for the Christian citizens of the Ottoman-controlled provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia. By the late 18th century, a number of defeats in several wars with Russia led some people in the Ottoman Empire to conclude that the reforms of Peter the Great had given the Russians an edge, and the Ottomans would have to keep up with Western technology in order to avoid further defeats.

Question: What are the advantages of using Digital-RGB LEDs in applications where maximum control and minimum visible electronics are required, such as Christmas strings and LED matrices?   Answer: The advantages of using Digital-RGB LEDs in applications where maximum control and minimum visible electronics are required, such as Christmas strings and LED matrices, are that they provide connections for data-in, data-out, and sometimes a clock or strobe signal, allowing for the microprocessor to control the brightness and color of each LED independently of the others. Additionally, some Digital-RGB LEDs have refresh rates in the kHz range, allowing for basic video applications.   Context: Digital-RGB LEDs are RGB LEDs that contain their own "smart" control electronics. In addition to power and ground, these provide connections for data-in, data-out, and sometimes a clock or strobe signal. These are connected in a daisy chain, with the data in of the first LED sourced by a microprocessor, which can control the brightness and color of each LED independently of the others. They are used where a combination of maximum control and minimum visible electronics are needed such as strings for Christmas and LED matrices. Some even have refresh rates in the kHz range, allowing for basic video applications.   Score: 0.893168092 
Question: What are some examples of anticircumvention exemptions that have been in place under the DMCA in relation to copyright infringement?   Answer: Examples of anticircumvention exemptions that have been in place under the DMCA in relation to copyright infringement include: software designed to filter websites that are generally seen to be inefficient (child safety and public library website filtering software); and the circumvention of copy protection mechanisms that have malfunctioned, have caused the instance of the work to become inoperable or which are no longer supported by their manufacturers.   Context: Title I of the U.S. DMCA, the WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act has provisions that prevent persons from "circumvent[ing] a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work". Thus if a distributor of copyrighted works has some kind of software, dongle or password access device installed in instances of the work, any attempt to bypass such a copy protection scheme may be actionable – though the US Copyright Office is currently reviewing anticircumvention rulemaking under DMCA – anticircumvention exemptions that have been in place under the DMCA include those in software designed to filter websites that are generally seen to be inefficient (child safety and public library website filtering software) and the circumvention of copy protection mechanisms that have malfunctioned, have caused the instance of the work to become inoperable or which are no longer supported by their manufacturers.

Question: What was John von Neumann's contribution to game theory and how did his collaboration with Oskar Morgenstern lead to the publication of a significant book on the subject?   Answer: John von Neumann's contribution to game theory was the minimax theorem, which showed that the minimaxes of two players in a game are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). He also extended the theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players. His collaboration with Oskar Morgenstern began when Morgenstern showed him a paper he had written on game theory. Von Neumann suggested that Morgenstern add more to the paper, and eventually the paper became a 100-page book, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, which was published in 1944. The book was met with great public interest, and The New York Times ran a front-page story about it. The book declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, such as convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.   Context: Such strategies, which minimize the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern wrote a paper on game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.

Question: What impact has Israel's involvement in international humanitarian missions had on the affected countries?   Answer: Israel's involvement in international humanitarian missions has had a positive impact on the affected countries. The medical teams sent to Haiti and Japan provided much needed medical care and assistance to those affected by natural disasters. The equipment donated by the departing emergency teams in Japan was also greatly appreciated. In addition, Israel's humanitarian efforts have helped to build bridges between countries and foster better international relations.   Context: Between 1985 and 2015, Israel sent 24 delegations of IDF search and rescue unit to 22 countries. In Haiti, immediately following the 2010 earthquake, Israel was the first country to set up a field hospital capable of performing surgical operations. Israel sent over 200 medical doctors and personnel to start treating injured Haitians at the scene. At the conclusion of its humanitarian mission 11 days later, the Israeli delegation had treated more than 1,110 patients, conducted 319 successful surgeries, delivered 16 births and rescued or assisted in the rescue of four individuals. Despite radiation concerns, Israel was one of the first countries to send a medical delegation to Japan following the earthquake and tsunami disaster. Israel dispatched a medical team to the tsunami-stricken city of Kurihara in 2011. A medical clinic run by an IDF team of some 50 members featured pediatric, surgical, maternity and gynecological, and otolaryngology wards, together with an optometry department, a laboratory, a pharmacy and an intensive care unit.

Question: How did the critical and commercial reception to the PlayStation 3 change over time, and what factors contributed to its improvement?   Answer: The critical and commercial reception to the PlayStation 3 improved over time due to a series of price revisions, the victory of Blu-ray over HD DVD, and the release of several well-received titles. These factors allowed the console to become more accessible and attractive to consumers, leading to an increase in sales and more positive reviews. Additionally, the console's game line-up was judged to be the best of 2008, according to IGN's review scores. This further contributed to the improved reception of the PlayStation 3.   Context: Critical and commercial reception to PS3 improved over time, after a series of price revisions, Blu-ray's victory over HD DVD, and the release of several well received titles. Ars Technica's original launch review gave PS3 only a 6/10, but second review of the console in June 2008 rated it a 9/10. In September 2009, IGN named PlayStation 3 the 15th best gaming console of all time, behind both of its competitors: Wii (10th) and Xbox 360 (6th).

Answer: The main challenges faced by the Gelug religious leaders during the Ming dynasty in their relations with the Rinpungpa princes and their attempts to gain influence in Lhasa were the Rinpungpa's shifting authority over large areas of Ü-Tsang, the Rinpungpa's occupation of Lhasa in 1498 and exclusion of the Gelug from attending New Years ceremonies and prayers, and the Drikung Kagyu abbot of Drigung Monastery's threat to Lhasa in 1537.   Context: The Association for Asian Studies states that there is no known written evidence to suggest that later leaders of the Gelug—Gendün Drup (1391–1474) and Gendün Gyatso (1475–1571)—had any contacts with Ming China. These two religious leaders were preoccupied with an overriding concern for dealing with the powerful secular Rinpungpa princes, who were patrons and protectors of the Karma Kargyu lamas. The Rinpungpa leaders were relatives of the Phagmodrupa, yet their authority shifted over time from simple governors to rulers in their own right over large areas of Ü-Tsang. The prince of Rinbung occupied Lhasa in 1498 and excluded the Gelug from attending New Years ceremonies and prayers, the most important event in the Gelug. While the task of New Years prayers in Lhasa was granted to the Karmapa and others, Gendün Gyatso traveled in exile looking for allies. However, it was not until 1518 that the secular Phagmodru ruler captured Lhasa from the Rinbung, and thereafter the Gelug was given rights to conduct the New Years prayer.

Question: What were the reasons behind the Ming court's lack of concern for Tibet during the Mongol presence and how did this contribute to the Mongols reclaiming their old vassal?   Answer: The Ming court's lack of concern for Tibet during the Mongol presence was due to their focus on internal affairs and their lack of resources to devote to foreign affairs. This allowed the Mongols to take advantage of the political vacuum in Tibet and reclaim their old vassal. The mass Mongol conversion to Tibetan Buddhism under Altan Khan also likely contributed to the Mongols reclaiming their old vassal, as it provided them with a religious and cultural connection to Tibet.   Context: Kolmaš writes that, as the Mongol presence in Tibet increased, culminating in the conquest of Tibet by a Mongol leader in 1642, the Ming emperors "viewed with apparent unconcern these developments in Tibet." He adds that the Ming court's lack of concern for Tibet was one of the reasons why the Mongols pounced on the chance to reclaim their old vassal of Tibet and "fill once more the political vacuum in that country."

Question: What factors contribute to the movement of glaciers, and how does the accumulation of snow and ice in a cirque play a role in this process?   Answer: The movement of glaciers is caused by a combination of surface slope, gravity, and pressure. The accumulation of snow and ice in a cirque is what creates the pressure that causes the glacier to move. As snow and ice accumulate in the cirque, the weight of the snow and ice compresses the snow, turning it into glacial ice. This glacial ice builds up until it is heavy enough to move due to the combination of surface slope, gravity, and pressure.   Context: Glaciers form where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds ablation. The area in which a glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm) - a typically armchair-shaped geological feature (such as a depression between mountains enclosed by arêtes) - which collects and compresses through gravity the snow which falls into it. This snow collects and is compacted by the weight of the snow falling above it forming névé. Further crushing of the individual snowflakes and squeezing the air from the snow turns it into 'glacial ice'. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it 'overflows' through a geological weakness or vacancy, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure. On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15 m (50 ft) of snow-ice.   Score: 0.874386549 
Question: What was the significance of Hot Springs, Arkansas in the history of spring training for Major League Baseball teams?   Answer: Hot Springs, Arkansas was significant in the history of spring training for Major League Baseball teams because it was the first place that the Chicago White Stockings (today's Chicago Cubs) began spring training in 1886. This concept of spring training was then adopted by other teams, and Hot Springs, Arkansas became a popular destination for Major League teams to hold their spring training. Whittington Park (1894), Majestic Park (1909) and Fogel Field (1912) were all built in Hot Springs specifically to host Major League teams.   Context: The Chicago White Stockings, (today's Chicago Cubs), began spring training in Hot Springs, Arkansas in 1886. President Albert Spalding (founder of Spalding Sporting Goods) and player/manager Cap Anson brought their players to Hot Springs and played at the Hot Springs Baseball Grounds. The concept was for the players to have training and fitness before the start of the regular season. After the White Stockings had a successful season in 1886, winning the National League Pennant, other teams began bringing their players to "spring training".  The Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Browns, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Spiders, Detroit Tigers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, New York Highlanders, Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Red Sox were among the early squads to arrive. Whittington Park (1894) and later Majestic Park (1909) and Fogel Field (1912) were all built in Hot Springs specifically to host Major League teams.   Score: 0.876384139 
Question: What factors contributed to the significant decline in viewership and ratings for American Idol in seasons 12 and 13, and how did this impact the show's overall standing in the Nielsen rankings?   Answer: The significant decline in viewership and ratings for American Idol in seasons 12 and 13 can be attributed to the arrival of new shows such as The Voice and The X-Factor, which provided viewers with more options for reality singing competitions. This caused a steep drop in ratings for season eleven, with the first two episodes falling 16–21% in overall viewer numbers and 24–27% in the 18/49 demo, and the season finale falling 27% in total viewer number and 30% in the 18-49 demo. The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers for the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo. Season 12 saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18-49 demo, with the finale having 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season, and a drop of 44% in the 18-49 demo. The season viewers averaged at 13.3 million, a drop of 24% from the previous season. The thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18–49 demographic, a drop of 28% from the twelfth season. As a result, American Idol lost its Top 10 position in the Nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013–14 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003, although the entire series to date had not yet been dropped from the Nielsen Top 30 rankings since its inception in 2002.   Context: Season eleven, however, suffered a steep drop in ratings, a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as The Voice and The X-Factor. The ratings for the first two episodes of season eleven fell 16–21% in overall viewer numbers and 24–27% in the 18/49 demo, while the season finale fell 27% in total viewer number and 30% in the 18-49 demo. The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo. For the first time in eight years, American Idol lost the leading position in both the total viewers number and the 18/49 demo, coming in second to NBC Sunday Night Football, although the strengths of Idol in its second year in the Wednesday-Thursday primetime slots helped Fox achieve the longest period of 18-49 demographic victory in the Nielsen ratings, standing at 8 straight years from 2004 to 2012.

Question: How has Peruvian Carnival evolved over time to incorporate elements of violence, and what impact has this had on Peruvian society?   Answer: Peruvian Carnival has evolved over time to incorporate elements of violence, reflecting the urban violence in Peruvian society following the internal conflict in Peru. This evolution began in the second half of the 20th century, when the festivities began to include playing with dirty water, mud, oil and colorants, as well as fighting and sometimes looting private property and sexual assaults on women. As a result of this increased violence, the government imposed penalties of up to eight years in prison for violence during the games. This has had a significant impact on Peruvian society, as it has become an excuse for criminal gangs to rob people while pretending to celebrate.   Context: Peruvian Carnival incorporates elements of violence and reflects the urban violence in Peruvian society following the internal conflict in Peru. Traditionally, Peruvian Andean festivities were held on this period every year because it is the rainy season. It was already violent during the 19th century, but the government limited the practice. During the early 20th century it consisted partying and parading, while in the second half of the 20th century it acquired violent characteristics that continued. It was banned, first from the streets in 1958 and altogether in 1959 by the Prado government. It consisted basically of water battles in a traditional way,[clarification needed] while in later years it included playing with dirty water, mud, oil and colorants -and also including fighting and sometimes looting private property and sexual assaults on women. It has become an excuse for criminal gangs to rob people while pretending to celebrate. As of 2010, it had become so violent that the government imposed penalties of up to eight years in prison for violence during the games (the games themselves are not forbidden, but using violence during the games or coercing others to participate is).

Question: What were the significant contributions of Luigi Galvani to the field of electricity and its applications?   Answer: Luigi Galvani made significant contributions to the field of electricity and its applications. He discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg to twitch, which he incorrectly thought was an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity. This discovery led to the development of the galvanic cell and the process of galvanization, which paved the way for electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection.   Context: William Champion's brother, John, patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process. Prior to this, only calamine could be used to produce zinc. In 1798, Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter. Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium, which processed even more zinc. Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg to twitch. He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect "animal electricity". The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection.

Question: What are some examples of syncretistic development in Buddhism as a result of its exposure to different influences from Persian, Greek, and non-Buddhist Indian civilizations?   Answer: Examples of syncretistic development in Buddhism as a result of its exposure to different influences from Persian, Greek, and non-Buddhist Indian civilizations include the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. Additionally, the Buddhist canon includes the immortalization of a Greek king, Menander.   Context: The gradual spread of Buddhism into adjacent areas meant that it came into contact with new ethnical groups. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, to changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions—themselves influenced by Buddhism. Striking examples of this syncretistic development can be seen in the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and in the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra.

Question: What were the reasons behind the breakdown of diplomatic relations between the US and Libya during the 1980s?   Answer: The reasons behind the breakdown of diplomatic relations between the US and Libya during the 1980s were primarily due to Ronald Reagan's hard line approach to Libya, which he erroneously considered to be a puppet regime of the Soviet Union. This led to the US implementing an embargo of Libyan oil, closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., and ordering all US companies to cease operating in the country. Additionally, diplomatic relations broke down with the UK after Libyan diplomats were accused in the shooting death of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984.   Context: In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan pursued a hard line approach to Libya, erroneously considering it a puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed as a part of its territorial waters – in August 1981 the U.S. shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised U.S. companies operating in the country to reduce the number of American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the U.S. implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all U.S. companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the U.K., after Libyan diplomats were accused in the shooting death of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984.

Question: What factors contributed to Rupert Murdoch's successful acquisition of The Sun newspaper despite initial rejection from IPC and pressure from print unions?   Answer: Rupert Murdoch's successful acquisition of The Sun newspaper was likely due to a combination of factors. Firstly, he offered fewer redundancies than the other potential buyer, Robert Maxwell, which was attractive to the print unions. Secondly, he promised to publish a "straightforward, honest newspaper" which would continue to support Labour, which was attractive to IPC. Finally, Murdoch was able to pay for the newspaper in instalments, which was likely more attractive than Maxwell's offer of a lump sum payment.   Context: Seizing the opportunity to increase his presence on Fleet Street, he made an agreement with the print unions, promising fewer redundancies if he acquired the newspaper. He assured IPC that he would publish a "straightforward, honest newspaper" which would continue to support Labour. IPC, under pressure from the unions, rejected Maxwell's offer, and Murdoch bought the paper for £800,000, to be paid in instalments. He would later remark: "I am constantly amazed at the ease with which I entered British newspapers."   Score: 0.904424608 
Question: What are some potential hazards associated with the failure of capacitors when subjected to excessive voltages or currents?   Answer: Potential hazards associated with the failure of capacitors when subjected to excessive voltages or currents include arcing that vaporizes the dielectric fluid, resulting in case bulging, rupture, or even an explosion; overheating, especially in the center of the capacitor rolls; and violent explosions when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit. High voltage vacuum capacitors can also generate soft X-rays even during normal operation.   Context: Capacitors may catastrophically fail when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating, or as they reach their normal end of life. Dielectric or metal interconnection failures may create arcing that vaporizes the dielectric fluid, resulting in case bulging, rupture, or even an explosion. Capacitors used in RF or sustained high-current applications can overheat, especially in the center of the capacitor rolls. Capacitors used within high-energy capacitor banks can violently explode when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit. High voltage vacuum capacitors can generate soft X-rays even during normal operation. Proper containment, fusing, and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards.   Score: 0.915248334 
Question: What role did the polished stone axe play in enabling Neolithic people to clear forests on a large scale and exploit their newly won farmland?   Answer: The polished stone axe played a crucial role in enabling Neolithic people to clear forests on a large scale and exploit their newly won farmland. The axe allowed them to cut down trees and clear large areas of land, which they could then use for farming. The adze, which was used to fashion wood for shelter, structures, and canoes, also played an important role in this process.   Context: Neolithic people were skilled farmers, manufacturing a range of tools necessary for the tending, harvesting and processing of crops (such as sickle blades and grinding stones) and food production (e.g. pottery, bone implements). They were also skilled manufacturers of a range of other types of stone tools and ornaments, including projectile points, beads, and statuettes. But what allowed forest clearance on a large scale was the polished stone axe above all other tools. Together with the adze, fashioning wood for shelter, structures and canoes for example, this enabled them to exploit their newly won farmland.   Score: 0.90903157 
Question: What strategies do major airports employ to regulate costs and keep prices comparable to "street prices" for products and services offered within their departure areas?   Answer: Major airports employ a variety of strategies to regulate costs and keep prices comparable to "street prices" for products and services offered within their departure areas. These strategies include setting price caps, negotiating with vendors to offer discounted prices, and offering incentives to customers who purchase items at the airport. Additionally, some airports have implemented loyalty programs that reward customers for their purchases, which can help to keep prices competitive.   Context: Most major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants. Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to "street prices".

Question: What role did Saint Dominic and his companions play in establishing the Dominican tradition of sponsoring widespread institutions of learning?   Answer: Saint Dominic and his companions played a key role in establishing the Dominican tradition of sponsoring widespread institutions of learning by taking up residence at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina in 1220. At the order's first General Chapter in May 1220, it was mandated that each new priory of the order maintain its own studium conventuale, thus laying the foundation of the Dominican tradition of sponsoring widespread institutions of learning. The official foundation of the Dominican convent at Santa Sabina with its studium conventuale occurred with the legal transfer of property from Honorius III to the Order of Preachers on June 5, 1222.   Context: In 1219 Pope Honorius III invited Saint Dominic and his companions to take up residence at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina, which they did by early 1220. Before that time the friars had only a temporary residence in Rome at the convent of San Sisto Vecchio which Honorius III had given to Dominic circa 1218 intending it to become a convent for a reformation of nuns at Rome under Dominic's guidance. In May 1220 at Bologna the order's first General Chapter mandated that each new priory of the order maintain its own studium conventuale thus laying the foundation of the Dominican tradition of sponsoring widespread institutions of learning. The official foundation of the Dominican convent at Santa Sabina with its studium conventuale occurred with the legal transfer of property from Honorius III to the Order of Preachers on June 5, 1222. This studium was transformed into the order's first studium provinciale by Saint Thomas Aquinas in 1265. Part of the curriculum of this studium was relocated in 1288 at the studium of Santa Maria sopra Minerva which in the 16th century world be transformed into the College of Saint Thomas (Latin: Collegium Divi Thomæ).

Answer: The key factors that led to the formation of the Labour Party in the late 19th century and its subsequent connection to trade unions and socialist groups were the increasing number of the urban proletariat, the extension of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the Liberal Party's endorsement of trade-union sponsored candidates, and the formation of small socialist groups with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. These groups included the Independent Labour Party, the Fabian Society, the Marxist Social Democratic Federation, and the Scottish Labour Party. The Taff Vale judgement, which was reversed by the new Liberal Government, also played a role in the formation of the Labour Party.   Context: The Labour Party's origins lie in the late 19th century, when it became apparent that there was a need for a new political party to represent the interests and needs of the urban proletariat, a demographic which had increased in number and had recently been given franchise. Some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the Liberal Party endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates.

Question: What are the differences between wood-free papers and tree-free papers, and why do wood-free papers not contain lignin?   Answer: The main difference between wood-free papers and tree-free papers is that wood-free papers are made from chemical pulps, while tree-free papers are made from other materials such as cotton. Wood-free papers do not contain lignin because it is dissolved in a cooking liquor and washed away from the cellulose fibres during the chemical pulping process. This preserves the length of the cellulose fibres and prevents the lignin from deteriorating over time.   Context: To make pulp from wood, a chemical pulping process separates lignin from cellulose fibres. This is accomplished by dissolving lignin in a cooking liquor, so that it may be washed from the cellulose; this preserves the length of the cellulose fibres. Paper made from chemical pulps are also known as wood-free papers–not to be confused with tree-free paper; this is because they do not contain lignin, which deteriorates over time. The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper, but this consumes 5% of the fibres; chemical pulping processes are not used to make paper made from cotton, which is already 90% cellulose.

There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-236 and -240, which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244. It is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay, which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.   Score: 0.892831683 
Question: What were the major export commodities from Plymouth during the 16th century?   Answer: The major export commodities from Plymouth during the 16th century were locally produced wool.   Context: During the 16th century locally produced wool was the major export commodity. Plymouth was the home port for successful maritime traders, among them Sir John Hawkins, who led England's first foray into the Atlantic slave trade, as well as Sir Francis Drake, Mayor of Plymouth in 1581 and 1593. According to legend, Drake insisted on completing his game of bowls on the Hoe before engaging the Spanish Armada in 1588. In 1620 the Pilgrim Fathers set sail for the New World from Plymouth, establishing Plymouth Colony – the second English colony in what is now the United States of America.   Score: 0.887466848 
Question: What factors contributed to the failure of implementing Wever's vision for the new Luftwaffe and the shift towards ground support operations in the German air services during that time?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the failure of implementing Wever's vision for the new Luftwaffe and the shift towards ground support operations in the German air services during that time included the deliberate separation of the Luftwaffe from the rest of the military structure, which created a major "communications gap" between Hitler and the Luftwaffe; Göring's fear of Hitler, which led him to falsify or misrepresent information; and Göring's decision against continuing Wever's original heavy bomber programme in 1937. Additionally, the enthusiasm of Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek for ground-support operations, as well as the Luftwaffe's existing approach to warfare, which favored joint inter-service operations over independent strategic air campaigns, also contributed to the shift.   Context: In 1936, Wever was killed in an air crash. The failure to implement his vision for the new Luftwaffe was largely attributable to his immediate successors. Ex-Army personnel Albert Kesselring and Hans-Jürgen Stumpff are usually blamed for the turning away from strategic planning and focusing on close air support. However, it would seem the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were actually Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek. These men were long-time professional airmen involved in German air services since early in their careers. The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations because of pressure from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel. It was instead a mission that suited the Luftwaffe's existing approach to warfare; a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns.   Score: 0.912878 
Question: What were the consequences of Gorbachev's refusal to make changes to the status of Nagorno Karabakh during the dissolution of the Soviet Union?   Answer: The consequences of Gorbachev's refusal to make changes to the status of Nagorno Karabakh during the dissolution of the Soviet Union included the sacking of the Communist Party Leaders in both Republics, the formation of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan, gun battles between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, the expulsion of Azerbaijanis from Armenia, mass demonstrations in Baku, the deployment of Soviet militia, the unfurling of the First Armenian Republic flag, the adoption of a resolution by the Armenian Supreme Soviet, the deployment of armored vehicles, and the expulsion of the Azerbaijani minority in Armenia. These events ultimately led to the military commandant taking control of Yerevan in order to prevent further ethnic violence.   Context: Gorbachev refused to make any changes to the status of Nagorno Karabakh, which remained part of Azerbaijan. He instead sacked the Communist Party Leaders in both Republics – on May 21, 1988, Kamran Baghirov was replaced by Abdulrahman Vezirov as First Secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist Party. From July 23 to September 1988, a group of Azerbaijani intellectuals began working for a new organization called the Popular Front of Azerbaijan, loosely based on the Estonian Popular Front. On September 17, when gun battles broke out between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis near Stepanakert, two soldiers were killed and more than two dozen injured. This led to almost tit-for-tat ethnic polarization in Nagorno-Karabakh's two main towns: The Azerbaijani minority was expelled from Stepanakert, and the Armenian minority was expelled from Shusha. On November 17, 1988, in response to the exodus of tens of thousands of Azerbaijanis from Armenia, a series of mass demonstrations began in Baku's Lenin Square, lasting 18 days and attracting half a million demonstrators. On December 5, 1988, the Soviet militia finally moved in, cleared the square by force, and imposed a curfew that lasted ten months.   Score: 0.887283504

Question: What impact has the establishment of regional offices by the Royal Institute of British Architects had on architectural development in the United Kingdom?   Answer: The establishment of regional offices by the Royal Institute of British Architects has had a positive impact on architectural development in the United Kingdom. By having regional offices, the Institute has been able to provide more localized support and resources to architects in different parts of the country. This has enabled architects to better understand the local context and develop designs that are more suited to the specific needs of the area. Additionally, the presence of regional offices has helped to foster a sense of community among architects, allowing them to collaborate and share ideas more easily.

Question: What were the responsibilities and roles of the paterfamilias in the household cult in ancient Rome?   Answer: The paterfamilias was the senior priest of the household and was responsible for offering daily cult to the lares and penates, as well as the di parentes/divi parentes, at the domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth. The materfamilias was responsible for the household's cult to Vesta. In rural estates, the bailiffs were responsible for some of the household shrines (lararia) and their deities. The paterfamilias also functioned as the priest of the household cult, with members of his familia acting as acolytes and assistants.   Context: A pater familias was the senior priest of his household. He offered daily cult to his lares and penates, and to his di parentes/divi parentes at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth. His wife (mater familias) was responsible for the household's cult to Vesta. In rural estates, bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines (lararia) and their deities. Household cults had state counterparts.

Question: What impact did Florida's felony disenfranchisement law have on the outcome of the closely contested 2000 election?   Answer: Florida's felony disenfranchisement law had a significant impact on the outcome of the 2000 election. According to a 2002 study in the American Sociological Review, if the state's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted at the same rate as other Floridians, Al Gore would have won Florida—and the presidency—by more than 80,000 votes. This would have been enough to overturn the 500 vote margin that George W. Bush won by in the state.   Context: In the closely contested 2000 election, the state played a pivotal role. Out of more than 5.8 million votes for the two main contenders Bush and Al Gore, around 500 votes separated the two candidates for the all-decisive Florida electoral votes that landed Bush the election win. Florida's felony disenfranchisement law is more severe than most European nations or other American states. A 2002 study in the American Sociological Review concluded that "if the state’s 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted at the same rate as other Floridians, Democratic candidate Al Gore would have won Florida—and the presidency—by more than 80,000 votes."

Context: On January 21, 1990, Rukh organized a 300-mile (480 km) human chain between Kiev, Lviv, and Ivano-Frankivsk. Hundreds of thousands joined hands to commemorate the proclamation of Ukrainian independence in 1918 and the reunification of Ukrainian lands one year later (1919 Unification Act). On January 23, 1990, the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church held its first synod since its liquidation by the Soviets in 1946 (an act which the gathering declared invalid). On February 9, 1990, the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice officially registered Rukh. However, the registration came too late for Rukh to stand its own candidates for the parliamentary and local elections on March 4. At the 1990 elections of people's deputies to the Supreme Council (Verkhovna Rada), candidates from the Democratic Bloc won landslide victories in western Ukrainian oblasts.

Question: What are some significant contributions of the pharmaceutical industry in improving hypertension treatment and reducing mortality rates?   Answer: The pharmaceutical industry has made significant contributions to improving hypertension treatment and reducing mortality rates. These contributions include the development of thiazide antihypertensive drugs, which reduce the risk of death, stroke, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular events in people with high blood pressure; the development of loop diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers, which are widely used in combination therapy; and the discovery and development of hydralazine, the first orally available vasodilator, and chlorothiazide, which remains the most widely used antihypertensive drug today. These developments have been associated with a substantial decline in the mortality rate among people with hypertension.

Question: How did the role of religious officials in pre-modern cultures shape the access to and understanding of the divine for the general masses?   Answer: Religious officials in pre-modern cultures acted as spiritual intermediaries to the common person, providing access to the divine and helping to shape the understanding of it. They held positions of power and were able to enforce the social order of ceremony and morals in a culture. Through these intermediaries, the general masses were able to access the divine and gain a better understanding of it.   Context: In the Pre-Modern era, many people's sense of self and purpose was often expressed via a faith in some form of deity, be that in a single God or in many gods. Pre-modern cultures have not been thought of creating a sense of distinct individuality, though. Religious officials, who often held positions of power, were the spiritual intermediaries to the common person.

Question: What are the key differences in embryological development between protostomes and deuterostomes in terms of the formation of the digestive tract, mesoderm development, and cell division patterns?   Answer: The key differences in embryological development between protostomes and deuterostomes in terms of the formation of the digestive tract are that in protostomes, the first opening of the gut to appear in embryological development (the archenteron) develops into the mouth, with the anus forming secondarily, while in deuterostomes the anus forms first, with the mouth developing secondarily. In terms of mesoderm development, in most protostomes, cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, while in deuterostomes, it forms through invagination of the endoderm, called enterocoelic pouching. Finally, in terms of cell division patterns, deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while protostomes undergo spiral cleavage.   Context: Deuterostomes differ from protostomes in several ways. Animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract. However, in protostomes, the first opening of the gut to appear in embryological development (the archenteron) develops into the mouth, with the anus forming secondarily.

Question: How has the concept of federalism evolved in Brazil since the fall of the monarchy in 1889?   Answer: Since the fall of the monarchy in 1889, the concept of federalism in Brazil has evolved to become a key part of the country's government. Initially established by decree by Deodoro da Fonseca, federalism has been confirmed by every Brazilian constitution since 1891. However, some of these constitutions have distorted some of the federalist principles, such as the 1937 Constitution which granted the federal government the authority to appoint State Governors at will, thus centralizing power in the hands of the President. Despite this, Brazil remains one of the largest federal governments in the world and continues to use the Fonseca system to regulate interstate trade.   Context: In Brazil, the fall of the monarchy in 1889 by a military coup d'état led to the rise of the presidential system, headed by Deodoro da Fonseca. Aided by well-known jurist Ruy Barbosa, Fonseca established federalism in Brazil by decree, but this system of government would be confirmed by every Brazilian constitution since 1891, although some of them would distort some of the federalist principles. The 1937 Constitution, for example, granted the federal government the authority to appoint State Governors (called interventors) at will, thus centralizing power in the hands of President Getúlio Vargas.

Question: What were the consequences and impact of the Wafd government's decision to abrogate the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the subsequent pressure it put on Gamal Abdel Nasser to take action?   Answer: The consequences and impact of the Wafd government's decision to abrogate the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the subsequent pressure it put on Gamal Abdel Nasser to take action were significant. The abrogation of the treaty was popular among the Egyptian people, and the government-sponsored guerrilla attacks against the British further increased the pressure on Nasser to act. This led to Nasser's decision to wage a large-scale assassination campaign, which ultimately failed and resulted in an innocent female passerby being wounded. Nasser's decision to take action was also met with criticism from liberal and Islamist critics in Egypt, who blamed the 1952 revolution's shortcomings on Nasser's concentration of power and lack of democracy.   Context: On 11 October 1951, the Wafd government abrogated the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which had given the British control over the Suez Canal until 1956. The popularity of this move, as well as that of government-sponsored guerrilla attacks against the British, put pressure on Nasser to act. According to Sadat, Nasser decided to wage "a large scale assassination campaign". In January 1952, he and Hassan Ibrahim attempted to kill the royalist general Hussein Sirri Amer by firing their submachine guns at his car as he drove through the streets of Cairo.

Question: How has the changing accessibility and specialization of scientific research affected the literary nature of science writing over the past two centuries?   Answer: The changing accessibility and specialization of scientific research has caused the literary nature of science writing to become less pronounced over the last two centuries. As scientific research has become more specialized and inaccessible to most audiences, scientific works of Aristotle, Copernicus, and Newton have become outdated and too technical to be included in most programmes of literary study. As a result, students outside of "history of science" programmes rarely read such works.   Context: As advances and specialization have made new scientific research inaccessible to most audiences, the "literary" nature of science writing has become less pronounced over the last two centuries. Now, science appears mostly in journals.

Question: What were some of the consequences and criticisms faced by King George VI for associating himself with a politician during a time of growing likelihood of war in Europe?   Answer: Consequences and criticisms faced by King George VI for associating himself with a politician during a time of growing likelihood of war in Europe included public disapproval of his actions, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family. His behaviour was also described by historian John Grigg as "the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century". Additionally, the abdication crisis of 1936 was seen to have done "more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda", further damaging the public's faith in the monarchy.   Context: The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler. However, when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family. While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian John Grigg to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as "the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century".

Question: What are some of the key elements that contribute to Madonna's success as a songwriter, as mentioned in the provided context?   Answer: Some of the key elements that contribute to Madonna's success as a songwriter, as mentioned in the provided context, are her self-revelation, her skill for developing "incredible" hooks for her songs, her ability to write autobiographical lyrics, her use of innuendos and double entendres, and her nomination for the Songwriters Hall of Fame.   Context: Throughout her career Madonna has been involved in writing and producing most of her own music. Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: "I don't know where [the songs] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'." Mark Kamins, her first producer, believed that Madonna is "a much underrated musician and lyricist." Rolling Stone has named her "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing "incredible" hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single "Into the Groove" and its line "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine." Madonna's songwriting are often autobiographical over the years, dealing with various themes from love and relationships to self-respect and female empowerment. Her songs also speak about taboo and unconventional issues of their period, such as sexuality and AIDS on Erotica (1992). Many of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which lead to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame twice, for 2014 and 2016 ceremony.

Question: What are some recent studies that have shown the positive effects of listening to classical music on academic performance?   Answer: Recent studies that have shown the positive effects of listening to classical music on academic performance include Mike Manthei and Steve N. Kelly of the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Donald A. Hodges and Debra S. O'Connell of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and other studies conducted through the University of Colorado.   Context: In 1996–1997, a research study was conducted on a large population of middle age students in the Cherry Creek School District in Denver, Colorado, USA. The study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores. The research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores. Students who listened to rock-and-roll or country had moderately lower scores. The study further indicated that students who used classical during the course of study had a significant leap in their academic performance; whereas, those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores. The research was conducted over several schools within the Cherry Creek School District and was conducted through University of Colorado. This study is reflective of several recent studies (i.e. Mike Manthei and Steve N. Kelly of the University of Nebraska at Omaha; Donald A. Hodges and Debra S. O'Connell of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; etc.) and others who had significant results through the discourse of their work.   Score: 0.914546669 
Question: What are some historical uses of mercury and its alloys?   Answer: Historical uses of mercury and its alloys include gilding objects with precious metals, such as armor and mirrors, and extracting precious metals like gold and silver from their ores. Mercury-tin amalgams were also used by the ancient Romans for gilding their armor.   Context: Mercury has been smelted from cinnabar for thousands of years. Mercury dissolves many metals, such as gold, silver, and tin, to form amalgams (an alloy in a soft paste, or liquid form at ambient temperature). Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for plating objects with precious metals, called gilding, such as armor and mirrors. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind. Mercury was often used in mining, to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores.   Score: 0.894470215 
Question: What factors have contributed to FC Barcelona's overwhelming dominance over Espanyol in the history of La Liga, despite the latter's occasional victories and achievements?   Answer: The factors that have contributed to FC Barcelona's overwhelming dominance over Espanyol in the history of La Liga include the club's financial resources, its ability to attract and retain top players, and its strong fan base. Additionally, Barcelona has had a long history of success in the league, having won the title 26 times since 1928, while Espanyol has only won the title once. This has given Barcelona a psychological edge over Espanyol, as the club has been able to consistently outperform its rival. Finally, Barcelona's home stadium, Camp Nou, is one of the largest and most intimidating stadiums in the world, which has given the club a significant home-field advantage.   Context: Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 80 seasons (1928–2015) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5–0 on five occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975 and 1992).

Answer: The books of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John all portray Jesus' crucifixion in similar ways, with Jesus being crucified alongside two rebels and the day going dark for three hours. However, there are some differences in the details. In Mark, Jesus calls out to God and then gives a shout before dying. Matthew adds an earthquake and the resurrection of saints. Luke portrays Jesus as impassive in the face of his crucifixion and describes the rebels as common criminals, one of whom defends Jesus, who in turn promises that he and the criminal will be together in paradise. John includes several of the same elements as those found in Mark, though they are treated differently.   Context: In Mark, Jesus is crucified along with two rebels, and the day goes dark for three hours. Jesus calls out to God, then gives a shout and dies. The curtain of the Temple is torn in two.

Question: What are the paradoxes discussed by U.S. Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen regarding the financial crisis of 2007-08 and its impact on the economy?   Answer: The paradoxes discussed by U.S. Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen regarding the financial crisis of 2007-08 and its impact on the economy are that the massive credit crunch caused a recession, which in turn deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell and credit losses of financial institutions surged. This created an adverse feedback loop that spread to nearly every corner of the economy, with consumers pulling back on purchases, businesses cancelling planned investments and laying off workers, and financial institutions shrinking assets to bolster capital. Yellen also discussed the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms to return the economy to a normal state can nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.   Context: During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen discussed these paradoxes: "Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole."

Question: What is the significance of the cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals in terms of their beliefs on blood transfusions?   Answer: The cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals is significant because it allows Jehovah's Witnesses to make their own decisions about which blood plasma fractions they are willing to accept, while still adhering to their beliefs on blood transfusions. This arrangement also allows medical professionals and hospitals to be aware of the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses and to provide them with the necessary medical care without requiring them to accept blood transfusions.   Context: Though Jehovah's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood, they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion. The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components, in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept.

Question: What were the main factors that contributed to the heavy smog and severe pollution in Nanjing during the period mentioned in the context?   Answer: The main factors that contributed to the heavy smog and severe pollution in Nanjing during the period mentioned in the context were a lack of cold air flow, slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in North China region.   Context: A dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at "severely polluted" for five straight days and "heavily polluted" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December.

Question: What were some of the beliefs and practices associated with magic in the Graeco-Roman world, and how did they differ from the role of magi in ancient Persia?   Answer: In the Graeco-Roman world, magic was believed to be a form of spellcasting that could be used to achieve a desired outcome. Magi were believed to have a special connection with the gods that allowed them to cast powerful spells. In contrast, magi in ancient Persia were believed to be priests who had a special knowledge of the future and could perform miraculous cures. They were also believed to have the ability to vanish into thin air.   Context: In the Graeco-Roman world, practitioners of magic were known as magi (singular magus), a "foreign" title of Persian priests. Apuleius, defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells, defined the magician as "in popular tradition (more vulgari)... someone who, because of his community of speech with the immortal gods, has an incredible power of spells (vi cantaminum) for everything he wishes to." Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical "History of magical arts" from their supposed Persian origins to Nero's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods. Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a magus, "despite his special knowledge of the future, his miraculous cures, and his ability to vanish into thin air".

Question: How do intermediaries such as authors, publishers, and websites that allow users to download peer-to-peer networking software contribute to copyright infringement, even if they do not host or transmit infringing content themselves?   Answer: Intermediaries such as authors, publishers, and websites that allow users to download peer-to-peer networking software can contribute to copyright infringement by providing access to torrent files that make reference to files that contain copyrighted content, and by pointing to trackers that coordinate the sharing of those files. Additionally, some torrent indexing and search sites, such as The Pirate Bay, encourage the use of magnet links, which allow users to obtain torrent files from other peers, rather than from a particular website. This creates another layer of indirection that can facilitate copyright infringement.   Context: These types of intermediaries do not host or transmit infringing content, themselves, but may be regarded in some courts as encouraging, enabling or facilitating infringement by users. These intermediaries may include the author, publishers and marketers of peer-to-peer networking software, and the websites that allow users to download such software. In the case of the BitTorrent protocol, intermediaries may include the torrent tracker and any websites or search engines which facilitate access to torrent files. Torrent files don't contain copyrighted content, but they may make reference to files that do, and they may point to trackers which coordinate the sharing of those files. Some torrent indexing and search sites, such as The Pirate Bay, now encourage the use of magnet links, instead of direct links to torrent files, creating another layer of indirection; using such links, torrent files are obtained from other peers, rather than from a particular website.

Question: What were some notable developments in the house music genre in Britain during the 90s, and how did it impact the international influence of house music?   Answer: In Britain during the 90s, the house music genre saw notable developments such as the emergence of house and rave clubs such as Lakota and Cream, the 'chilling out' concept with ambient house albums such as The KLF's Chill Out and Analogue Bubblebath by Aphex Twin, and the Godskitchen superclub brand. These developments helped to bolster the popularity of house music in Britain and increased its international influence. In addition, the indie dance scene in Britain during the 90s also helped to further house music's international influence, with bands such as Deee-Lite leading the way. Two distinctive tracks from this era were the Orb's "Little Fluffy Clouds" and the Happy Mondays' "Wrote for Luck" ("WFL"), which was transformed into a dance hit by Vince Clarke.   Context: The house scene in cities such as Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield and London were also provided with many underground Pirate Radio stations and DJs alike which helped bolster an already contagious, but otherwise ignored by the mainstream, music genre.

Question: What were the events that led to the United Kingdom and France declaring war against Russia during the Crimean War?   Answer: The events that led to the United Kingdom and France declaring war against Russia during the Crimean War were the Anglo-French naval squadron entering the Azov Sea to undermine Russian communications and supplies to besieged Sevastopol, the British-French warships entering the Kerch Strait and destroying the coast battery of the Kamishevaya Bay, and the gunboats and armed steamers attacking the seaport of Taganrog.   Context: This view of 'diplomatic drift' as the cause of the war was first popularised by A. W, Kinglake, who portrayed the British as victims of newspaper sensationalism and duplicitous French and Ottoman diplomacy. More recently, the historians Andrew Lambert and Winfried Baumgart have argued that, first, Britain was following a geopolitical strategy in aiming to destroy a fledgling Russian Navy which might challenge the Royal Navy for control of the seas, and second that the war was a joint European response to a century of Russian expansion not just southwards but also into western Europe.

Question: In what ways did the dispute over licensing rights for MP3 players between SanDisk and Sisvel exemplify the challenges and complexities of patent enforcement in Germany?   Answer: The dispute between SanDisk and Sisvel over licensing rights for MP3 players exemplified the challenges and complexities of patent enforcement in Germany in several ways. First, the Italian patents firm was able to win an injunction against SanDisk in a German court, demonstrating the ability of foreign entities to enforce their patents in Germany. Second, the injunction was later reversed by a Berlin judge, only to be blocked the same day by another judge from the same court, showing the difficulty of enforcing a consistent patent policy in Germany. Finally, the dispute was described as "bringing the Patent Wild West to Germany," highlighting the chaotic nature of patent enforcement in the country.   Context: In September 2006, German officials seized MP3 players from SanDisk's booth at the IFA show in Berlin after an Italian patents firm won an injunction on behalf of Sisvel against SanDisk in a dispute over licensing rights.

Question: How have technological advancements such as computers and electron microscopes contributed to the increased level of detail studied and the speed at which data can be analyzed in the field of botany?   Answer: Technological advancements such as computers and electron microscopes have enabled botanists to study plants in greater detail and analyze data more quickly. Computers allow for the storage and analysis of large amounts of data, while electron microscopes allow for the observation of structures at a much smaller scale than was previously possible. This has allowed botanists to gain a better understanding of the relationships between different plant species, as well as the process of evolution in plants. Additionally, the use of DNA evidence has enabled botanists to more accurately classify plants into various taxa.   Context: 20th century developments in plant biochemistry have been driven by modern techniques of organic chemical analysis, such as spectroscopy, chromatography and electrophoresis. With the rise of the related molecular-scale biological approaches of molecular biology, genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, the relationship between the plant genome and most aspects of the biochemistry, physiology, morphology and behaviour of plants can be subjected to detailed experimental analysis. The concept originally stated by Gottlieb Haberlandt in 1902 that all plant cells are totipotent and can be grown in vitro ultimately enabled the use of genetic engineering experimentally to knock out a gene or genes responsible for a specific trait, or to add genes such as GFP that report when a gene of interest is being expressed. These technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in bioreactors to synthesise pesticides, antibiotics or other pharmaceuticals, as well as the practical application of genetically modified crops designed for traits such as improved yield.

Context: On one hand, this means that the Belgian political landscape, generally speaking, consists of only two components: the Dutch-speaking population represented by Dutch-language political parties, and the majority populations of Wallonia and Brussels, represented by their French-speaking parties. The Brussels region emerges as a third component. This specific dual form of federalism, with the special position of Brussels, consequently has a number of political issues—even minor ones—that are being fought out over the Dutch/French-language political division. With such issues, a final decision is possible only in the form of a compromise.

Question: What factors contributed to the significant increase in spending on uranium exploration between 2004 and 2007, and what implications did this trend have for the global uranium market?   Answer: The significant increase in spending on uranium exploration between 2004 and 2007 was largely due to the dramatic rise in uranium prices. Prices went from about $10/lb in May 2003 to $138/lb in July 2007, which caused a big increase in spending on exploration. This trend had a number of implications for the global uranium market. Firstly, it encouraged more exploration and development of uranium resources, leading to an increase in the amount of economically viable uranium reserves. Secondly, it encouraged investment in the uranium market, leading to increased demand and higher prices. Finally, it led to increased instability in the uranium market, as the price of uranium was subject to large fluctuations.   Context: It is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at US$59 per lb of uranium, while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources (reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction). Prices went from about $10/lb in May 2003 to $138/lb in July 2007. This has caused a big increase in spending on exploration, with US$200 million being spent worldwide in 2005, a 54% increase on the previous year. This trend continued through 2006, when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over $774 million, an increase of over 250% compared to 2004.

Question: How did the region of Eritrea get its name and what were the significant historical events that shaped its identity as a state?   Answer: The region of Eritrea got its name from the ancient Greek name for the Red Sea (Ἐρυθρὰ Θάλασσα Erythra Thalassa), which was first formally adopted in 1890 with the formation of Italian Eritrea (Colonia Eritrea). During the Middle Ages, the region was known as Medri Bahri ("sea-land"). In 1936, Eritrea became the Eritrea Governorate within Italian East Africa. In 1953, Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia (nominally within a federation until 1962), and an Eritrean Liberation Front was formed in 1960. Eritrea gained independence following a 1993 referendum, and the name of the new state was defined as State of Eritrea in the 1997 constitution.   Context: During the Middle Ages, the Eritrea region was known as Medri Bahri ("sea-land"). The name Eritrea is derived from the ancient Greek name for Red Sea (Ἐρυθρὰ Θάλασσα Erythra Thalassa, based on the adjective ἐρυθρός erythros "red").

Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia in 1953 (nominally within a federation until 1962) and an Eritrean Liberation Front formed in 1960. Eritrea gained independence following the 1993 referendum, and the name of the new state was defined as State of Eritrea in the 1997 constitution.[citation needed]   Score: 0.863694489 
Question: What were the main military actions and outcomes during the Crimean War in relation to the movement of Russian and Turkish forces?   Answer: The main military actions and outcomes during the Crimean War in relation to the movement of Russian and Turkish forces were that in the north, Russian forces under Eristov pushed southwest, fought two battles, forced the Turks back to Batum, and retired behind the Cholok River. In the far south, Russian forces under Wrangel pushed west, fought a battle, and occupied Bayazit. In the center, the main forces stood at Kars and Gyumri, both slowly approaching along the Kars-Gyumri road and facing each other, neither side choosing to fight. On 4 August, Russian scouts saw a movement which they thought was the start of a withdrawal, and the Russians advanced and the Turks attacked first. The Turks were defeated, losing 8000 men to the Russian 3000, and 10000 irregulars deserted to their villages. Both sides withdrew to their former positions.   Context: In the north Eristov pushed southwest, fought two battles, forced the Turks back to Batum, retired behind the Cholok River and suspended action for the rest of the year (June).

Question: What were the reasons behind President Wilson's decision to send U.S. forces to occupy the Mexican city of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution in 1914?   Answer: President Wilson's decision to send U.S. forces to occupy the Mexican city of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution in 1914 was motivated by a desire to show the U.S. was keenly interested in the civil war and would not tolerate attacks on Americans, especially the April 9, 1914, "Tampico Affair", which involved the arrest of American sailors by soldiers of the regime of Mexican President Victoriano Huerta. Additionally, Wilson wanted to send a message to the German Secret Service, which had been encouraging Pancho Villa in his attacks to involve the United States in an intervention in Mexico, that the U.S. would not be distracted from its growing involvement in the war and would not divert aid from Europe to support the intervention.   Context: The Mexican Revolution involved a civil war with hundreds of thousands of deaths and large numbers fleeing combat zones. Tens of thousands fled to the U.S. President Wilson sent U.S. forces to occupy the Mexican city of Veracruz for six months in 1914. It was designed to show the U.S. was keenly interested in the civil war and would not tolerate attacks on Americans, especially the April 9, 1914, "Tampico Affair", which involved the arrest of American sailors by soldiers of the regime of Mexican President Victoriano Huerta. In early 1916 Pancho Villa a Mexican general ordered 500 soldiers on a murderous raid on the American city of Columbus New Mexico, with the goal of robbing banks to fund his army. The German Secret Service encouraged Pancho Villa in his attacks to involve the United States in an intervention in Mexico which would distract the United States from its growing involvement in the war and divert aid from Europe to support the intervention. Wilson called up the state militias (National Guard) and sent them and the U.S. Army under General John J. Pershing to punish Villa in the Pancho Villa Expedition. Villa fled, with the Americans in pursuit deep into Mexico, thereby arousing Mexican nationalism. By early 1917 President Venustiano Carranza had contained Villa and secured the border, so Wilson ordered Pershing to withdraw.   Score: 0.893181503

Question: How does the historical one-drop rule impact the ethnic solidarity of African Americans, regardless of their multiracial admixture or social/economic stratification?   Answer: The historical one-drop rule has had a significant impact on the ethnic solidarity of African Americans, regardless of their multiracial admixture or social/economic stratification. The one-drop rule, which states that any person with any amount of African ancestry is considered African American, has created a sense of unity among African Americans, regardless of their racial or ethnic background. This has allowed African Americans to come together and form a strong sense of solidarity, even in the face of discrimination and oppression.   Context: For African Americans, the one-drop rule was a significant factor in ethnic solidarity. African Americans generally shared a common cause in society regardless of their multiracial admixture, or social/economic stratification. Additionally, African Americans found it, near, impossible to learn about their Indigenous American heritage as many family elders withheld pertinent genealogical information. Tracing the genealogy of African Americans can be a very difficult process, especially for descendants of Indigenous Americans, because African Americans who were slaves were forbidden to learn to read and write, and a majority of Indigenous Americans neither spoke English, nor read or wrote it.

Question: How does the rule regarding penalties differ for the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play compared to other situations in Canadian football?   Answer: The rule regarding penalties for the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is that the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. In other situations, the non-penalized team will have the option of declining the penalty and the results of the previous play will stand as if the penalty had not been called.   Context: In most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of declining the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs: the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback.   Score: 0.915614

Question: What were the two types of clergy during the Middle Ages and how did their social backgrounds differ?   Answer: The two types of clergy during the Middle Ages were the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a religious rule and were usually monks. The secular clergy were usually drawn from the nobility, while the local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class.   Context: The clergy was divided into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a religious rule and were usually monks. Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population, usually less than one per cent. Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility, the same social class that served as the recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy. The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded.

Question: What factors contribute to the emergence of upgraded polytechnics and institutes of technology, and how does this impact the quality of teaching and graduates' preparation for the workplace?   Answer: The emergence of upgraded polytechnics and institutes of technology is largely due to a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools, as well as an administrative change of statutes, which often includes a name change with the introduction of new designations like institute of technology, polytechnic university, university of applied sciences, or university of technology for marketing purposes. This has caused concern as the lack of specialized intermediate technical professionals lead to industrial skill shortages in some fields, as well as an increase in the graduate unemployment rate. Additionally, evidence has shown a decline in the general quality of teaching and graduate's preparation for the workplace, due to the fast-paced conversion of these technical institutions to more advanced higher level institutions.   Context: In a number of countries, although being today generally considered similar institutions of higher learning across many countries, polytechnics and institutes of technology used to have a quite different statute among each other, its teaching competences and organizational history. In many cases polytechnic were elite technological universities concentrating on applied science and engineering and may also be a former designation for a vocational institution, before it has been granted the exclusive right to award academic degrees and can be truly called an institute of technology. A number of polytechnics providing higher education is simply a result of a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools. In some situations, former polytechnics or other non-university institutions have emerged solely through an administrative change of statutes, which often included a name change with the introduction of new designations like institute of technology, polytechnic university, university of applied sciences, or university of technology for marketing purposes. Such emergence of so many upgraded polytechnics, former vocational education and technical schools converted into more university-like institutions has caused concern where the lack of specialized intermediate technical professionals lead to industrial skill shortages in some fields, being also associated to an increase of the graduate unemployment rate. This is mostly the case in those countries, where the education system is not controlled by the state and everybody can grant degrees.[citation needed] Evidence have also shown a decline in the general quality of teaching and graduate's preparation for the workplace, due to the fast-paced conversion of that technical institutions to more advanced higher level institutions. Mentz, Kotze and Van der Merwe (2008) argues that all the tools are in place to promote the debate on the place of technology in higher education in general and in Universities of Technology specifically. The aspects of this debate can follow the following lines: • To what degree is technology defined as a concept? • What is the scope of technology discourse? • What is the place and relation of science with technology? • How useful is the Mitcham framework in thinking about technology in South Africa? • Can a measure of cooperation as opposed to competition be achieved amongst higher education institutions? • Who ultimately is responsible for vocational training and what is the role of technology in this?

Question: What are the potential challenges faced by older or stripped-down systems in handling Daylight Saving Time changes?   Answer: Older or stripped-down systems may have difficulty automatically adjusting clocks for Daylight Saving Time changes. These systems may not be able to recognize policy changes by various jurisdictions of the dates and timings of DST, leading to confusion and disruption. Additionally, mechanical clocks may not be able to be moved backward safely, leading to further confusion and disruption.   Context: DST's clock shifts have the obvious disadvantage of complexity. People must remember to change their clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.   Score: 0.877407253 
Question: What are some of the tools that the central bank can use in a financial crisis to ensure adequate liquidity in the financial system?   Answer: Some of the tools that the central bank can use in a financial crisis to ensure adequate liquidity in the financial system include: 1. Purchasing large amounts of assets such as commercial paper. 2. Sterilisation, in which highly valued assets are sold at the same time that the weaker assets are purchased, to keep the money supply neutral. 3. Accepting the bad assets as long-term collateral to be held until their market value stabilises. 4. Adjustments in taxation and expenditure in the economies of the weaker states to improve the perceived value of the assets.   Context: In central banking, the privileged status of the central bank is that it can make as much money as it deems needed. In the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve buys assets: typically, bonds issued by the Federal government. There is no limit on the bonds that it can buy and one of the tools at its disposal in a financial crisis is to take such extraordinary measures as the purchase of large amounts of assets such as commercial paper. The purpose of such operations is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available for functioning of the financial system.   Score: 0.853423417 
Question: What were the actions taken by central banks and governments in response to the predicted worldwide recession in 2009?   Answer: In response to the predicted worldwide recession in 2009, central banks and governments took several actions. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank both reduced their interest rates from 4.5% down to 3%, and from 3.75% down to 3.25%. Additionally, several countries launched large "help packages" for their economies, such as tax cuts, increased government spending, and financial aid to businesses.

Question: How did the geopolitical structure of the Ottoman Empire impact its economic structure and trade routes during its zenith?   Answer: The geopolitical structure of the Ottoman Empire during its zenith had a significant impact on its economic structure and trade routes. The Empire stood between the West and the East, blocking the land route eastward and forcing Spanish and Portuguese navigators to set sail in search of a new route to the Orient. The Empire also controlled the spice route that Marco Polo once used, giving them a monopoly on trade in the region. However, the discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to bypass the Ottoman trade monopoly, leading to a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese.   Context: The economic structure of the Empire was defined by its geopolitical structure. The Ottoman Empire stood between the West and the East, thus blocking the land route eastward and forcing Spanish and Portuguese navigators to set sail in search of a new route to the Orient. The Empire controlled the spice route that Marco Polo once used.

Question: What factors contributed to the shift in perspective on the existence of biological races in college textbooks between 1932 and 1989, as described in the study?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the shift in perspective on the existence of biological races in college textbooks between 1932 and 1989, as described in the study, were the avoidance of discussing the political implications of racial classifications, the ongoing discussions in biology about the validity of the concept "subspecies", and the abandonment of the race concept in some widely used textbooks in biology.   Context: The authors of the study also examined 77 college textbooks in biology and 69 in physical anthropology published between 1932 and 1989. Physical anthropology texts argued that biological races exist until the 1970s, when they began to argue that races do not exist. In contrast, biology textbooks did not undergo such a reversal but many instead dropped their discussion of race altogether. The authors attributed this to biologists trying to avoid discussing the political implications of racial classifications, instead of discussing them, and to the ongoing discussions in biology about the validity of the concept "subspecies". The authors also noted that some widely used textbooks in biology such as Douglas J. Futuyama's 1986 "Evolutionary Biology" had abandoned the race concept, "The concept of race, masking the overwhelming genetic similarity of all peoples and the mosaic patterns of variation that do not correspond to racial divisions, is not only socially dysfunctional but is biologically indefensible as well (pp. 5 18-5 19)."

Question: What evidence suggests that Antarctica once had a subtropical climate and flora, along with a marsupial fauna, during the Cretaceous period?   Answer: The evidence that suggests that Antarctica once had a subtropical climate and flora, along with a marsupial fauna, during the Cretaceous period is that by the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a subtropical climate and flora, complete with a marsupial fauna.   Context: Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic, around 160 Ma, followed by the Indian subcontinent in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Ma). By the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a subtropical climate and flora, complete with a marsupial fauna. In the Eocene epoch, about 40 Ma Australia-New Guinea separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear.

Question: What are some similarities and differences between the development of lower-case scripts in the Greek alphabet and other alphabets?   Answer: Similarities: - Both the Greek and other alphabets developed lower-case scripts in the 7th century. - Both the Greek and other alphabets acquired their quadrilinear form in the 8th century. - Both the Greek and other alphabets mixed uncial letter forms into the script. - Both the Greek and other alphabets had majuscule and minuscule letters, but the difference between the two variants was initially stylistic rather than orthographic. Differences: - The earliest dated Greek lower-case text is the Uspenski Gospels (MS 461) in the year 835, while other alphabets did not make the case distinction before about 1300. - The modern practice of capitalising the first letter of every sentence seems to be imported (and is rarely used when printing Ancient Greek materials even today), while other alphabets did not have this practice.   Context: Similar developments have taken place in other alphabets. The lower-case script for the Greek alphabet has its origins in the 7th century and acquired its quadrilinear form in the 8th century.

Question: What were the factors that led the British to adopt the Bofors 40 mm and a twin barrel Vickers 2-pdr (40 mm) for anti-aircraft warfare in 1936?   Answer: The factors that led the British to adopt the Bofors 40 mm and a twin barrel Vickers 2-pdr (40 mm) for anti-aircraft warfare in 1936 were the results of their 1935 trials, which showed that the minimum effective round was an impact fused 2 lb HE shell, and the fact that the air-cooled Bofors was much lighter than the water-cooled pom-pom, making it vastly superior for land use. Additionally, UK production of the Bofors 40 mm was licensed, and the Kerrison Predictor was introduced with it.   Context: Until this time the British, at RAF insistence, continued their World War I use of machine guns, and introduced twin MG mountings for AAAD. The army was forbidden from considering anything larger than .50-inch. However, in 1935 their trials showed that the minimum effective round was an impact fused 2 lb HE shell.

Question: What is the distinction between regional languages and "dialects" in Italy, and why is it more accurate to classify them as individual languages?   Answer: The distinction between regional languages and "dialects" in Italy is that the regional languages are not derived from modern standard Italian, but instead evolved locally from Vulgar Latin independent of standard Italian, with little to no influence from what is now known as "standard Italian." Therefore, it is more accurate to classify them as individual languages rather than "dialects" due to the often high degree in which they lack mutual intelligibility. Additionally, the regional languages have their own distinct individual histories, and the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutually unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages.   Context: Italy is home to a vast array of native regional minority languages, most of which are Romance-based and have their own local variants. These regional languages are often referred to colloquially or in non-linguistic circles as Italian "dialects," or dialetti (standard Italian for "dialects"). However, the majority of the regional languages in Italy are in fact not actually "dialects" of standard Italian in the strict linguistic sense, as they are not derived from modern standard Italian but instead evolved locally from Vulgar Latin independent of standard Italian, with little to no influence from what is now known as "standard Italian."

Question: What were some of the different perspectives and arguments surrounding Darwin's book "On the Origin of Species" and its compatibility with theistic evolution and natural theology?   Answer: Darwin's book "On the Origin of Species" sparked a wide range of perspectives and arguments. Some argued that the book was incompatible with theistic evolution and natural theology, while others argued that it was compatible. Those who argued against compatibility argued that the book undermined the traditional view of a divinely created world and that it was incompatible with the idea of a benevolent God. Those who argued for compatibility argued that the book was compatible with theistic evolution and natural theology, as it provided evidence for the idea of a divinely created world and that the natural laws of the universe were designed by a benevolent God.   Context: The book aroused international interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much of the initial reaction was hostile, but Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas.

Question: What are some of the reasons why New York City's drinking water is considered pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants?   Answer: Some of the reasons why New York City's drinking water is considered pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants are: the integrity of the Catskill Mountains watershed, the natural water filtration system, and the lack of pollutants in the water supply. The Catskill Mountains watershed is protected, which helps to keep pollutants out of the water supply. The natural water filtration system also helps to keep pollutants out of the water supply. Additionally, the lack of pollutants in the water supply means that it does not need to be treated with water treatment plants.   Context: New York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As a result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants.

Question: What are some advantages of using halogen lamps over standard gas-filled lamps in terms of lifetime, filament temperature, and size?   Answer: The advantages of using halogen lamps over standard gas-filled lamps in terms of lifetime, filament temperature, and size are: Lifetime: The halogen cycle increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten from the inside of the bulb back onto the filament. Filament Temperature: The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Size: Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space.   Context: The halogen lamp reduces uneven evaporation of the filament and eliminates darkening of the envelope by filling the lamp with a halogen gas at low pressure, rather than an inert gas. The halogen cycle increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten from the inside of the bulb back onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. Fiber-optic lamps for optical microscopy is one typical application.   Score: 0.893333137 
Question: What were the demographic consequences of the Great Famine of 1315-1317 compared to the plagues that occurred later in the century, particularly the Black Death?   Answer: The demographic consequences of the Great Famine of 1315-1317 were not as severe as the plagues that occurred later in the century, particularly the Black Death. Estimates of the death rate caused by the Black Death range from one third to as much as sixty percent, while the death rate caused by the Great Famine was much lower.   Context: Around 1300–1350 the Medieval Warm Period gave way to the Little Ice Age. The colder climate resulted in agricultural crises, the first of which is known as the Great Famine of 1315-1317. The demographic consequences of this famine, however, were not as severe as the plagues that occurred later in the century, particularly the Black Death. Estimates of the death rate caused by this epidemic range from one third to as much as sixty percent. By around 1420, the accumulated effect of recurring plagues and famines had reduced the population of Europe to perhaps no more than a third of what it was a century earlier. The effects of natural disasters were exacerbated by armed conflicts; this was particularly the case in France during the Hundred Years' War.   Score: 0.897414148 
Question: What role did Saint Helena play as a rendezvous point for ships traveling between Asia and Europe?   Answer: Saint Helena served as an important rendezvous point and source of food for ships traveling between Asia and Europe. It was a place where ships could stop to restock their supplies and where sick mariners could be left to recover before taking passage on the next ship.   Context: The ship RMS Saint Helena runs between St Helena and Cape Town on a 5-day voyage, also visiting Ascension Island and Walvis Bay, and occasionally voyaging north to Tenerife and Portland, UK.

Question: What factors contributed to the development of the Xiamen dialect and its emergence as the main language in the Greater Xiamen area during the late Ming dynasty?   Answer: The main factors that contributed to the development of the Xiamen dialect and its emergence as the main language in the Greater Xiamen area during the late Ming dynasty were the increased trade and migration between Quanzhou and Xiamen, the need for a common language, and the dialect leveling that occurred as a result of the mixing of the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties. The Quanzhou traders travelling southwards to Xiamen and the Zhangzhou peasants travelling northwards to Xiamen in search of job opportunities created a need for a common language, which was eventually filled by the Xiamen dialect. The dialect leveling that occurred as a result of the mixing of the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties further contributed to the development of the Xiamen dialect and its emergence as the main language in the Greater Xiamen area.   Context: Xiamen dialect, sometimes known as Amoy, is the main dialect spoken in the Chinese city of Xiamen and its surrounding regions of Tong'an and Xiang'an, both of which are now included in the Greater Xiamen area. This dialect developed in the late Ming dynasty when Xiamen was increasingly taking over Quanzhou's position as the main port of trade in southeastern China. Quanzhou traders began travelling southwards to Xiamen to carry on their businesses while Zhangzhou peasants began traveling northwards to Xiamen in search of job opportunities. It is at this time when a need for a common language arose. The Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties are similar in many ways (as can be seen from the common place of Henan Luoyang where they originated), but due to differences in accents, communication can be a problem. Quanzhou businessmen considered their speech to be the prestige accent and considered Zhangzhou's to be a village dialect. Over the centuries, dialect leveling occurred and the two speeches mixed to produce the Amoy dialect.   Score: 0.862368822 
Question: What distinguishes Dwight D. Eisenhower from other presidents in terms of his age, military background, and prior political experience?   Answer: Dwight D. Eisenhower is distinguished from other presidents by his age, being the oldest man elected President since James Buchanan in 1856, and by his military background, being the only general to serve as President in the 20th century. He is also distinguished by his lack of prior political experience, being the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency.   Context: As the election approached, other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president. In January 1948, after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming Republican National Convention, Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was "not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office"; "life-long professional soldiers", he wrote, "in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason, [should] abstain from seeking high political office". Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time. Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president; Republican Thomas E. Dewey was considered the other probable winner, would presumably serve two terms, and Eisenhower, at age 66 in 1956, would then be too old.   Score: 0.874266505 
Question: What were the significant outcomes and implications of Napoleon's first major defeat in the Battle of Aspern-Essling?   Answer: The significant outcomes and implications of Napoleon's first major defeat in the Battle of Aspern-Essling were that it showed that Napoleon could be beaten on the battlefield, and it caused excitement throughout Europe. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, and both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. The French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling, and Napoleon was eventually forced to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. This defeat demonstrated that Napoleon's military tactics and strategies were not infallible, and it showed that his enemies could stand up to him and win. This was a major blow to Napoleon's reputation and it caused a shift in the balance of power in Europe.   Context: By 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.

Question: What factors have contributed to the decline of the once-vibrant Greek and Jewish communities in Egypt, and what impact has this had on the cultural landscape of the country?   Answer: The decline of the once-vibrant Greek and Jewish communities in Egypt has been largely attributed to emigration, war losses, and a decrease in fertility. This has had a significant impact on the cultural landscape of the country, as these communities were integral to the cultural identity of Egypt. The loss of these communities has resulted in a decrease in the diversity of the population, as well as a decrease in the number of cultural sites and monuments associated with these communities. Additionally, the loss of these communities has resulted in a decrease in the number of tourists visiting Egypt, as these communities were often a major draw for tourists.   Context: Greeks from Cyprus have a similar history of emigration, usually to the English-speaking world because of the island's colonization by the British Empire. Waves of emigration followed the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, while the population decreased between mid-1974 and 1977 as a result of emigration, war losses, and a temporary decline in fertility. After the ethnic cleansing of a third of the Greek population of the island in 1974, there was also an increase in the number of Greek Cypriots leaving, especially for the Middle East, which contributed to a decrease in population that tapered off in the 1990s. Today more than two-thirds of the Greek population in Cyprus is urban.   Score: 0.836122215 
Question: What were some of the early uses of asphalt/bitumen in Britain and who were the key figures involved in its introduction?   Answer: In Britain, some of the early uses of asphalt/bitumen included flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and waterproofing of various types of pools and baths. Key figures involved in its introduction included entrepreneurs on the London stockmarket who made claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from France, Germany and England, as well as those who were granted patents in France and those who had patent applications denied in England due to their similarity to each other. The type of asphalt most used in the 1840s and 50s was Claridge's.   Context: In 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving asphalt/bitumen, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt could also used for flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, with these latter themselves proliferating in the 19th century. On the London stockmarket, there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from France, Germany and England.

Question: What is the significance of the Pan-Slavic colors and why were they adopted by various Slavic peoples?   Answer: The Pan-Slavic colors were adopted by various Slavic peoples as a symbol of solidarity and unity. Initially, the colors were taken from the Russian flag, but as the Slavic movement grew, they were adopted by other Slavic peoples. The colors are seen as a representation of the shared culture and history of the Slavic peoples, and are a symbol of their shared identity. The flags of the Czech Republic and Poland use red for historic heraldic reasons, but not due to Pan-Slavic connotations. In 2004, Georgia adopted a new white flag, which consists of four small and one big red cross in the middle touching all four sides.

Question: How does multitasking affect the speed of a computer when it is switching between several programs?   Answer: Multitasking can cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running. However, if a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a "time slice" until the event it is waiting for has occurred, which frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.   Context: Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a "time slice" until the event it is waiting for has occurred.

Question: What are the key findings and implications of Hebb's distinction between short-term and long-term memory, and how have subsequent research and studies challenged and refined this initial understanding?   Answer: Hebb's initial distinction between short-term and long-term memory was that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Subsequent research has shown this to be false, as direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine can help the storage of recent experiences, and stimulation of the amygdala can enhance memory. It has also been found that excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage, and patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory and memory consolidation, and hippocampal damage may cause memory loss and problems with memory storage, including retrograde amnesia. The key findings and implications of Hebb's distinction between short-term and long-term memory are that memory consolidation is not necessarily a result of long-term storage, and that hormones and the amygdala can play a role in memory storage and retrieval. Subsequent research and studies have challenged and refined this initial understanding by showing that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine can help the storage of recent experiences, and that stimulation of the amygdala can enhance memory. They have also shown that excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage, and that patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones.   Context: Hebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory. He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also.

Question: What cultural shift in Roman society did the Augustan settlement build upon?   Answer: The cultural shift in Roman society that the Augustan settlement built upon was the increasing acceptance of divinely inspired personal character and policy, as evidenced by the appointment of Julius Caesar as pontifex maximus and the sponsorship of temples, priesthoods, and public ludi and munera by political candidates.   Context: The Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society. In the middle Republican era, even Scipio's tentative hints that he might be Jupiter's special protege sat ill with his colleagues. Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal; both Sulla and Pompey claimed special relationships with Venus. Julius Caesar went further, and claimed her as his ancestress. Such claims suggested personal character and policy as divinely inspired; an appointment to priesthood offered divine validation. In 63 BC, Julius Caesar's appointment as pontifex maximus "signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics". Likewise, political candidates could sponsor temples, priesthoods and the immensely popular, spectacular public ludi and munera whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic.

Question: How has the interpretation of the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution impacted the expansion of federal law into various areas such as aviation, telecommunications, railroads, pharmaceuticals, antitrust, and trademarks in the 20th century?   Answer: The interpretation of the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution has enabled federal law to expand into areas such as aviation, telecommunications, railroads, pharmaceuticals, antitrust, and trademarks in the 20th century. Broad interpretations of these clauses have allowed Congress to delegate authority to executive officers to create codes of "fair competition" and to set standards governing the actions of executive officers. This has allowed Congress to pass laws that regulate these areas and preempt state law in some cases.   Context: During the 18th and 19th centuries, federal law traditionally focused on areas where there was an express grant of power to the federal government in the federal Constitution, like the military, money, foreign relations (especially international treaties), tariffs, intellectual property (specifically patents and copyrights), and mail. Since the start of the 20th century, broad interpretations of the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution have enabled federal law to expand into areas like aviation, telecommunications, railroads, pharmaceuticals, antitrust, and trademarks. In some areas, like aviation and railroads, the federal government has developed a comprehensive scheme that preempts virtually all state law, while in others, like family law, a relatively small number of federal statutes (generally covering interstate and international situations) interacts with a much larger body of state law. In areas like antitrust, trademark, and employment law, there are powerful laws at both the federal and state levels that coexist with each other. In a handful of areas like insurance, Congress has enacted laws expressly refusing to regulate them as long as the states have laws regulating them (see, e.g., the McCarran-Ferguson Act).

Question: What are some of the factors contributing to the observed decreases in biodiversity and the potential extinction of up to 30% of all species by 2050?   Answer: Some of the factors contributing to the observed decreases in biodiversity and the potential extinction of up to 30% of all species by 2050 include: unsustainable ecological practices, such as over-exploitation of resources, habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and the introduction of invasive species. These activities are driven by human activities, such as industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural expansion. Additionally, the unequal distribution of resources between high-income and low-income countries has been identified as a contributing factor, as high-income countries are able to outsource resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.   Context: During the last century, decreases in biodiversity have been increasingly observed. In 2007, German Federal Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel cited estimates that up to 30% of all species will be extinct by 2050. Of these, about one eighth of known plant species are threatened with extinction. Estimates reach as high as 140,000 species per year (based on Species-area theory). This figure indicates unsustainable ecological practices, because few species emerge each year.[citation needed] Almost all scientists acknowledge that the rate of species loss is greater now than at any time in human history, with extinctions occurring at rates hundreds of times higher than background extinction rates. As of 2012, some studies suggest that 25% of all mammal species could be extinct in 20 years.   Score: 0.891446471 
Question: What evidence exists to support the claim that the accounts of the first Buddhist council are exaggerated or fictitious?   Answer: There is no direct evidence to support the claim that the accounts of the first Buddhist council are exaggerated or fictitious. However, some scholars have suggested that the accounts of the council may have been embellished over time, as the record of the council was initially transmitted orally and was not committed to text until the last century BCE. Additionally, some of the stories of the Gautama Buddha's previous lives may have been exaggerated or fabricated over time.   Context: According to the scriptures, soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's teachings. Upāli recited the vinaya. Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the dhamma. These became the basis of the Tripitaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in the last century BCE. Both the sūtras and the vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Gautama Buddha's previous lives, and various other subjects.

Question: What controversies surround the recognition of the Alsacian flag and how does it relate to the region's historical emblem?   Answer: The controversy surrounding the recognition of the Alsacian flag relates to the region's historical emblem, the Rot-un-Wiss. This flag is commonly found on the coat of arms of Alsacian cities and many Swiss cities, and is seen as a symbol of the region's Germanic roots. In 1949, the Rot-un-Wiss was replaced by a new "Union jack-like" flag representing the union of the two déprtements, but this flag has no real historical relevance. This has caused controversy as some statesmen have called it a Nazi invention, while its origins date back to the XIth century and the Red and White banner of Gérard de Lorraine (aka. d'Alsace). The Rot-un-Wiss flag is still seen as the real historical emblem of the region by most of the population and the departments' parliaments, and has been widely used during protests against the creation of a new "super-region" gathering Champagne-Ardennes, Lorraine and Alsace. However, with the purpose of "Frenchizing" the region, the Rot-un-Wiss has not been recognized by Paris.   Context: There is controversy around the recognition of the Alsacian flag. The authentic historical flag is the Rot-un-Wiss ; Red and White are commonly found on the coat of arms of Alsacian cities (Strasbourg, Mulhouse, Sélestat...) and of many Swiss cites, especially in Basel's region. The German region Hesse uses a flag similar to the Rot-un-Wiss. As it underlines the Germanic roots of the region, it was replaced in 1949 by a new "Union jack-like" flag representing the union of the two déprtements. It has, however, no real historical relevance. It has been since replaced again by a slightly different one, also representing the two départements. With the purpose of "Frenchizing" the region, the Rot-un-Wiss has not been recognized by Paris. Some overzealous statesmen have called it a Nazi invention - while its origins date back to the XIth century and the Red and White banner of Gérard de Lorraine (aka. d'Alsace). The Rot-un-Wiss flag is still known as the real historical emblem of the region by most of the population and the departments' parliaments and has been widely used during protests against the creation of a new "super-region" gathering Champagne-Ardennes, Lorraine and Alsace, namely on Colmar's statue of liberty.

Question: What were the privileges granted to the szlachta/nobility in Poland and how did it impact their role in state administration?   Answer: The privileges granted to the szlachta/nobility in Poland included the right to nullify the proceedings of a given sejm or sejmik by exercising their individual right of liberum veto, as well as other rights that were not available to the noble classes of other countries. This gave the nobility enormous influence over the country's politics, in some ways even greater than that enjoyed by the citizens of modern democratic countries. This state of affairs grew up in part because of the extinction of the male-line descendants of the old royal dynasty, and the selection by the nobility of the Polish king from among the dynasty's female-line descendants. This gave the nobility a great deal of power in state administration, as they were able to effectively control the selection of the king and the proceedings of the sejm and sejmik.   Context: There were a number of avenues to upward social mobility and the achievement of nobility. Poland's nobility was not a rigidly exclusive, closed class. Many low-born individuals, including townsfolk, peasants and Jews, could and did rise to official ennoblement in Polish society. Each szlachcic had enormous influence over the country's politics, in some ways even greater than that enjoyed by the citizens of modern democratic countries. Between 1652 and 1791, any nobleman could nullify all the proceedings of a given sejm (Commonwealth parliament) or sejmik (Commonwealth local parliament) by exercising his individual right of liberum veto (Latin for "I do not allow"), except in the case of a confederated sejm or confederated sejmik.

Question: What factors have contributed to the decline of hunter-gatherer lifestyles in various parts of the world?   Answer: The main factors that have contributed to the decline of hunter-gatherer lifestyles in various parts of the world include the spread of agriculture, the European Age of Discovery, and the encroachment of industrialization and urbanization. The spread of agriculture has led to the near-universal human reliance upon it, making it difficult for hunter-gatherer cultures to survive in areas suitable for agricultural use. The European Age of Discovery brought with it new technologies and resources that allowed for the exploitation of hunter-gatherer societies. Finally, the encroachment of industrialization and urbanization has led to the displacement of hunter-gatherer societies, as well as the destruction of their traditional habitats.

Question: What were the key factors that led to the successful passage of MAPS 3 in Oklahoma City?   Answer: The key factors that led to the successful passage of MAPS 3 in Oklahoma City were the positive results of the previous MAPS initiatives, the promise of a modern streetcar system, and the establishment of a transit hub. The previous MAPS initiatives had resulted in increased population living in downtown housing, as well as increased demand for residential and retail amenities. The promise of a modern streetcar system and the establishment of a transit hub provided further incentive for citizens to support the initiative.   Context: In 1993, the city passed a massive redevelopment package known as the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS), intended to rebuild the city's core with civic projects to establish more activities and life to downtown. The city added a new baseball park; central library; renovations to the civic center, convention center and fairgrounds; and a water canal in the Bricktown entertainment district. Water taxis transport passengers within the district, adding color and activity along the canal. MAPS has become one of the most successful public-private partnerships undertaken in the U.S., exceeding $3 billion in private investment as of 2010.

Question: What are the limitations of using a laser turntable in casual use compared to conventional stylus playback?   Answer: The limitations of using a laser turntable in casual use compared to conventional stylus playback are that the expense of the laser turntable limits its use primarily to digital archiving of analog records, and the laser does not play back colored vinyl or picture discs. Additionally, since the laser does not touch the record, the dust that vinyl attracts due to static electric charge is not mechanically pushed out of the groove, worsening sound quality in casual use.   Context: ELPJ, a Japanese-based company, sells a laser turntable that uses a laser to read vinyl discs optically, without physical contact. The laser turntable eliminates record wear and the possibility of accidental scratches, which degrade the sound, but its expense limits use primarily to digital archiving of analog records, and the laser does not play back colored vinyl or picture discs. Various other laser-based turntables were tried during the 1990s, but while a laser reads the groove very accurately, since it does not touch the record, the dust that vinyl attracts due to static electric charge is not mechanically pushed out of the groove, worsening sound quality in casual use compared to conventional stylus playback.

Question: What were the key factors that contributed to the fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes during the Middle Ages?   Answer: The key factors that contributed to the fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes during the Middle Ages were the refusal of the western Roman elites to support the army or pay taxes, intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites, the supply of material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders, the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters, the decline of taxation systems, and the weakening of the slave supply.   Context: The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire. Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as "invasions", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the Roman state. Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects. Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions. An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents. This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed. Warfare was common between and within the kingdoms.

Question: What were the reasons that led Germany to establish closer relations with the Soviet Union during the late 1930s to early 1940s?   Answer: The reasons that led Germany to establish closer relations with the Soviet Union during the late 1930s to early 1940s were primarily economic. An autarkic economic approach or an alliance with Britain were impossible, so Germany needed to obtain raw materials from the Soviet Union. Additionally, Germany expected a British blockade in the event of war, which would create massive shortages for Germany in a number of key raw materials. The third Soviet Five Year Plan also required new infusions of technology and industrial equipment, which Germany was able to provide. As a result, the leaders of the two countries began to meet more and more frequently to discuss trade and military supply needs.   Context: For Germany, because an autarkic economic approach or an alliance with Britain were impossible, closer relations with the Soviet Union to obtain raw materials became necessary, if not just for economic reasons alone. Moreover, an expected British blockade in the event of war would create massive shortages for Germany in a number of key raw materials. After the Munich agreement, the resulting increase in German military supply needs and Soviet demands for military machinery, talks between the two countries occurred from late 1938 to March 1939. The third Soviet Five Year Plan required new infusions of technology and industrial equipment.[clarification needed] German war planners had estimated serious shortfalls of raw materials if Germany entered a war without Soviet supply.

This movement was similar to the Renaissance in Europe during the 16th century in that it was a period of intellectual and cultural revival, although Europeans of that age were not confronted with the challenge and influence of alien colonialism.   Context: During this period, Bengal witnessed an intellectual awakening that is in some way similar to the Renaissance in Europe during the 16th century, although Europeans of that age were not confronted with the challenge and influence of alien colonialism. This movement questioned existing orthodoxies, particularly with respect to women, marriage, the dowry system, the caste system, and religion. One of the earliest social movements that emerged during this time was the Young Bengal movement, which espoused rationalism and atheism as the common denominators of civil conduct among upper caste educated Hindus. It played an important role in reawakening Indian minds and intellect across the sub-continent.   Score: 0.916729629 
Question: What were the casualties recorded for both the German and French forces during the last major cavalry engagement in Western Europe during the Franco-Prussian War?   Answer: The German Official History recorded 15,780 casualties and French casualties of 13,761 men during the last major cavalry engagement in Western Europe during the Franco-Prussian War.   Context: The casualties were horrible, especially for the attacking Prussian forces. A grand total of 20,163 German troops were killed, wounded or missing in action during the August 18 battle. The French losses were 7,855 killed and wounded along with 4,420 prisoners of war (half of them were wounded) for a total of 12,275. While most of the Prussians fell under the French Chassepot rifles, most French fell under the Prussian Krupp shells. In a breakdown of the casualties, Frossard's II Corps of the Army of the Rhine suffered 621 casualties while inflicting 4,300 casualties on the Prussian First Army under Steinmetz before the Pointe du Jour. The Prussian Guards Infantry Divisions losses were even more staggering with 8,000 casualties out of 18,000 men.

Question: What factors contributed to the erosion of Nintendo's dominance in the home console market in the post-SNES era, particularly in terms of third-party support for competing consoles?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the erosion of Nintendo's dominance in the home console market in the post-SNES era, particularly in terms of third-party support for competing consoles, were the less strict licensing terms of upstart competing consoles such as the Sega Genesis and the PlayStation, as well as the stronger third-party support enjoyed by Nintendo's rivals.   Context: In the longer run, however, with the NES near its end of its life many third-party publishers such as Electronic Arts supported upstart competing consoles with less strict licensing terms such as the Sega Genesis and then the PlayStation, which eroded and then took over Nintendo's dominance in the home console market, respectively. Consoles from Nintendo's rivals in the post-SNES era had always enjoyed much stronger third-party support than Nintendo, which relied more heavily on first-party games.   Score: 0.912239 
Question: What are the advantages of using paperfoam as an alternative to expanded plastic packaging in terms of environmental impact and recycling?   Answer: The advantages of using paperfoam as an alternative to expanded plastic packaging in terms of environmental impact and recycling are that it is biodegradable and can be recycled with ordinary paper. This means that it does not contribute to the accumulation of plastic waste in the environment, and it can be recycled in the same way as other paper products. Additionally, it has similar mechanical properties to some expanded plastic packaging, making it a viable alternative.   Context: Some manufacturers have started using a new, significantly more environmentally friendly alternative to expanded plastic packaging. Made out of paper, and known commercially as paperfoam, the new packaging has very similar mechanical properties to some expanded plastic packaging, but is biodegradable and can also be recycled with ordinary paper.

Question: How did the tactics and lessons learned from the Franco-Prussian War impact military thinking and the development of artillery and cavalry strategies in European armies by 1914?   Answer: The tactics and lessons learned from the Franco-Prussian War had a significant impact on military thinking and the development of artillery and cavalry strategies in European armies by 1914. The Prussian tactics of using artillery to silence French guns at long range and then to directly support infantry attacks at close range proved to be superior to the defensive doctrine employed by French gunners. This led to the adoption of these tactics by European armies, which was exemplified in the French 75, an artillery piece optimised to provide direct fire support to advancing infantry. Additionally, the Battle of Mars-la-Tours, in which the Prussian 12th Cavalry Brigade conducted a charge against a French artillery battery, was held to prove that cavalry charges could still prevail on the battlefield. However, the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 suggested that infantry armed with new smokeless-powder rifles could engage gun crews effectively, which forced gunners to fire at longer range using indirect fire, usually from a position of cover.   Context: The events of the Franco-Prussian War had great influence on military thinking over the next forty years. Lessons drawn from the war included the need for a general staff system, the scale and duration of future wars and the tactical use of artillery and cavalry. The bold use of artillery by the Prussians, to silence French guns at long range and then to directly support infantry attacks at close range, proved to be superior to the defensive doctrine employed by French gunners. The Prussian tactics were adopted by European armies by 1914, exemplified in the French 75, an artillery piece optimised to provide direct fire support to advancing infantry. Most European armies ignored the evidence of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 which suggested that infantry armed with new smokeless-powder rifles could engage gun crews effectively.

Question: What were the diversionary tactics employed by Napoleon to lure the Royal Navy away from the English Channel and weaken their defense of the Western Approaches?   Answer: The diversionary tactics employed by Napoleon to lure the Royal Navy away from the English Channel and weaken their defense of the Western Approaches involved the French Navy escaping from the British blockades of Toulon and Brest and threatening to attack the West Indies. It was hoped that the British would respond by sending ships to the Caribbean, allowing a combined Franco-Spanish fleet to take control of the channel long enough for French armies to cross and invade.   Context: Napoleon knew that the French fleet could not defeat the Royal Navy in a head-to-head battle, so he planned to lure it away from the English Channel through diversionary tactics. The main strategic idea involved the French Navy escaping from the British blockades of Toulon and Brest and threatening to attack the West Indies. In the face of this attack, it was hoped, the British would weaken their defense of the Western Approaches by sending ships to the Caribbean, allowing a combined Franco-Spanish fleet to take control of the channel long enough for French armies to cross and invade. However, the plan unraveled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805.

Question: What are the advantages of using gallium-nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) wafers for producing white LEDs compared to the traditional sapphire substrate?   Answer: The advantages of using gallium-nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) wafers for producing white LEDs compared to the traditional sapphire substrate are that they are cheaper and more abundant, and they can be produced in larger sizes. Additionally, the sapphire apparatus must be coupled with a mirror-like collector to reflect light that would otherwise be wasted, which is not necessary with GaN-on-Si wafers.   Context: A new style of wafers composed of gallium-nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) is being used to produce white LEDs using 200-mm silicon wafers. This avoids the typical costly sapphire substrate in relatively small 100- or 150-mm wafer sizes. The sapphire apparatus must be coupled with a mirror-like collector to reflect light that would otherwise be wasted. It is predicted that by 2020, 40% of all GaN LEDs will be made with GaN-on-Si. Manufacturing large sapphire material is difficult, while large silicon material is cheaper and more abundant. LED companies shifting from using sapphire to silicon should be a minimal investment.

Question: What are some exceptions to the pattern of bird species laying white or pale eggs, and how do these exceptions adapt for camouflage or spotting parasites' eggs?   Answer: One exception to the pattern of bird species laying white or pale eggs is the ground-nesting nightjars, which lay pale eggs. These birds rely on their plumage for camouflage instead of their eggs. Another exception is species that are victims of brood parasites, which have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg. This forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.   Context: All birds lay amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage.

Question: What are some arguments made by scholars and organizations who disagree with the concept of "separation of church and state" in the United States and how do they challenge the interpretation of the constitutional limitation on religious establishment?   Answer: Scholars and organizations who disagree with the concept of "separation of church and state" in the United States argue that the phrase misrepresents the textual requirements of the Constitution, as many aspects of church and state were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified. They argue that the prevalent degree of separation of church and state could not have been intended by the constitutional framers. They also point to religious references in official contexts, and such other founding documents as the United States Declaration of Independence, which references the idea of a "Creator" and "Nature's God", though these references did not ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any particular religious view of a "Creator" or "Nature's God." Critics of the modern concept of the "separation of church and state" argue that it is untethered to anything in the text of the constitution and is contrary to the conception of the phrase as the Founding Fathers understood it. Philip Hamburger, Columbia Law school professor and prominent critic of the modern understanding of the concept, maintains that the modern concept, which deviates from the constitutional establishment clause jurisprudence, is rooted in American anti-Catholicism and Nativism. Briefs before the Supreme Court, including by the U.S. government, have argued that some state constitutional amendments relating to the modern conception of separation of church and state (Blaine Amendments) were motivated by and intended to enact anti-Catholicism.

Question: What are the recent studies suggesting about the co-evolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the Great Oxidation Event?   Answer: Recent studies suggest that the co-evolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the Great Oxidation Event was driven by the need to counteract damaging redox reactions on a daily basis due to changes in environmental oxygen levels and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of daylight.   Context: What drove circadian rhythms to evolve has been an enigmatic question. Previous hypotheses emphasized that photosensitive proteins and circadian rhythms may have originated together in the earliest cells, with the purpose of protecting replicating DNA from high levels of damaging ultraviolet radiation during the daytime. As a result, replication was relegated to the dark. However, evidence for this is lacking, since the simplest organisms with a circadian rhythm, the cyanobacteria, do the opposite of this - they divide more in the daytime. Recent studies instead highlight the importance of co-evolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.3 billion years ago. The current view is that circadian changes in environmental oxygen levels and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of daylight are likely to have driven a need to evolve circadian rhythms to preempt, and therefore counteract, damaging redox reactions on a daily basis.

The battle saw three top leaders of the Umayyad clan (Utba ibn Rabi'ah, Walid ibn Utbah and Shaybah) killed by Hashimites (Ali, Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib and Ubaydah ibn al-Harith). This fueled the opposition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, the grandson of Umayya, to Muhammad and to Islam.

The animosity between the two clans was further exacerbated by the Battle of Uhud, which saw the Muslims suffer a defeat and Abu Sufyan's wife Hind cutting open the corpse of Hamza and attempting to eat his liver. This deepened the tribal animosity between the two clans and further hardened their attitudes towards Muhammad and Islam.   Context: While the Umayyads and the Hashimites may have had bitterness between the two clans before Muhammad, the rivalry turned into a severe case of tribal animosity after the Battle of Badr. The battle saw three top leaders of the Umayyad clan (Utba ibn Rabi'ah, Walid ibn Utbah and Shaybah) killed by Hashimites (Ali, Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib and Ubaydah ibn al-Harith) in a three-on-three melee.

Question: What were the key elements of the "dual strategy" adopted by the British government during the Seven Years' War?   Answer: The key elements of the "dual strategy" adopted by the British government during the Seven Years' War were naval blockade and bombardment of enemy ports, and rapid movement of troops by sea. They also harassed enemy shipping and attacked enemy colonies, often using colonists from nearby British colonies.   Context: The British—by inclination as well as for practical reasons—had tended to avoid large-scale commitments of troops on the Continent. They sought to offset the disadvantage of this in Europe by allying themselves with one or more Continental powers whose interests were antithetical to those of their enemies, particularly France.:15–16 By subsidising the armies of continental allies, Britain could turn London's enormous financial power to military advantage. In the Seven Years' War, the British chose as their principal partner the greatest general of the day, Frederick the Great of Prussia, then the rising power in central Europe, and paid Frederick substantial subsidies for his campaigns.:106 This was accomplished in the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, in which Britain ended its long-standing alliance with Austria in favor of Prussia, leaving Austria to side with France. In marked contrast to France, Britain strove to prosecute the war actively in the colonies, taking full advantage of its naval power. :64–66 The British pursued a dual strategy – naval blockade and bombardment of enemy ports, and rapid movement of troops by sea. They harassed enemy shipping and attacked enemy colonies, frequently using colonists from nearby British colonies in the effort.   Score: 0.869706929

Question: What are the rules for breaking a tie in Canadian football, and how do they differ between regular season games and playoff or championship games?   Answer: In Canadian football, if the game is tied at the end of regulation play, each team is given an equal number of chances to break the tie. A coin toss is held to determine which team will take possession first; the first team scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and advances through a series of downs until it scores or loses possession. If the team scores a touchdown, starting with the 2010 season, it is required to attempt a 2-point conversion. The other team then scrimmages the ball at the same 35-yard line and has the same opportunity to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team is ahead, then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if there is still no winner, during the regular season the game ends as a tie. In a playoff or championship game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines, until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions. Therefore, the rules for breaking a tie in Canadian football are the same for regular season games and playoff or championship games, except that in a playoff or championship game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions.

Question: What are some advantages and challenges of using liquid growth media for bacterial culture in comparison to solid growth media?   Answer: Advantages of using liquid growth media for bacterial culture include the ability to measure growth and produce large volumes of cells quickly and cheaply. Additionally, liquid growth media allows for even cell suspension, making it easier to divide and transfer cultures. Challenges of using liquid growth media for bacterial culture include difficulty in isolating single bacteria from the liquid media, as well as the need for selective media to identify specific organisms. Additionally, liquid growth media may not be able to provide the same level of protection from environmental stresses as solid growth media.   Context: In the laboratory, bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, are used to isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.   Score: 0.897398889 
Question: What is the significance of the MP3 lossy audio data compression algorithm in relation to the auditory masking phenomenon and the work of Ernst Terhardt et al.?   Answer: The MP3 lossy audio data compression algorithm takes advantage of the auditory masking phenomenon to reduce the size of audio files without significantly affecting the quality of the audio. Ernst Terhardt et al. created an algorithm that accurately describes the auditory masking phenomenon, which was used to develop the MP3 algorithm.   Context: The MP3 lossy audio data compression algorithm takes advantage of a perceptual limitation of human hearing called auditory masking. In 1894, the American physicist Alfred M. Mayer reported that a tone could be rendered inaudible by another tone of lower frequency. In 1959, Richard Ehmer described a complete set of auditory curves regarding this phenomenon. Ernst Terhardt et al. created an algorithm describing auditory masking with high accuracy.

Three of the men were sentenced to death (which was later reduced to life in prison), and the fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison. Two of the four men died in prison after serving almost 30 years, and two others were released after serving 32 and 36 years. Additionally, the U.S. Government was ordered to pay $100 million in damages to the four defendants.   Context: In 2003 a congressional committee called the FBI's organized crime informant program "one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement." The FBI allowed four innocent men to be convicted of the March 1965 gangland murder of Edward "Teddy" Deegan in order to protect Vincent Flemmi, an FBI informant. Three of the men were sentenced to death (which was later reduced to life in prison), and the fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison. Two of the four men died in prison after serving almost 30 years, and two others were released after serving 32 and 36 years.

Question: What factors contributed to the popularization of the spelling "Tennessee" during the 18th century?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the popularization of the spelling "Tennessee" during the 18th century include the use of the spelling by James Glen, the governor of South Carolina, in his official correspondence during the 1750s, and the publication of Henry Timberlake's "Draught of the Cherokee Country" in 1765. Additionally, the creation of "Tennessee County" by North Carolina in 1788, and the adoption of "Tennessee" as the name of the state when a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state out of the Southwest Territory, likely contributed to the popularization of the spelling.   Context: The modern spelling, Tennessee, is attributed to James Glen, the governor of South Carolina, who used this spelling in his official correspondence during the 1750s. The spelling was popularized by the publication of Henry Timberlake's "Draught of the Cherokee Country" in 1765. In 1788, North Carolina created "Tennessee County", the third county to be established in what is now Middle Tennessee.

Question: What is the significance of the Red Rose of Lancaster and how does it relate to the county's heraldic badge and flag?   Answer: The Red Rose of Lancaster is a symbol of the House of Lancaster and is found on the county's heraldic badge and flag. It is a reminder of the 15th-century Wars of the Roses, in which the House of Lancaster was represented by a red rose and the House of York was represented by a white rose. The traditional Lancashire flag, a red rose on a white field, was not officially registered, so Lancashire's official flag is registered as a red rose on a gold field.

Question: What were the main reasons for the Roman Empire's interest in Galicia, Spain during ancient times?   Answer: The main reasons for the Roman Empire's interest in Galicia, Spain during ancient times were its mineral resources, most notably gold, and its strategic location. The Romans also sought to bring new technologies, travel routes, forms of organizing property, and a new language (Latin) to the area.   Context: The Roman legions first entered the area under Decimus Junius Brutus in 137–136 BC, but the country was only incorporated into the Roman Empire by the time of Augustus (29 BC – 19 BC). The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources, most notably gold. Under Roman rule, most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned, and Gallaeci served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops. Romans brought new technologies, new travel routes, new forms of organizing property, and a new language; latin. The Roman Empire established its control over Galicia through camps (castra) as Aquis Querquennis, Ciadella camp or Lucus Augusti (Lugo), roads (viae) and monuments as the lighthouse known as Tower of Hercules, in Corunna, but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century of our era, when the gold mines stopped being productive, led to a lesser degree of Romanization.

Question: What factors contributed to the speculative run-up of oil futures prices traded off the regulated futures exchanges in London and New York during the financial crisis of 2007-08?   Answer: Factors that contributed to the speculative run-up of oil futures prices traded off the regulated futures exchanges in London and New York during the financial crisis of 2007-08 include: speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities, monetary policy, and the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world, leading to long positions taken on those markets, such as Chinese increasing presence in Africa. Additionally, a pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has been identified as a contributory factor in the financial crisis.   Context: Rapid increases in a number of commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble. The price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $147 from early 2007 to 2008, before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008. Experts debate the causes, with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities, some to monetary policy, and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world, leading to long positions taken on those markets, such as Chinese increasing presence in Africa. An increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline, which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries, as wealth flows to oil-producing states. A pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has been recently identified.

Question: What are some key insights from the rise of field physics in the 19th century that challenge the traditional concept of matter as tangible "stuff"?   Answer: 1. Matter and energy are interchangeable, meaning that energy is prima materia and matter is one of its forms. 2. Fields are prima materia and the energy is a property of the field. 3. The extrapolation of the direct 'actuality' of the world around us into the atomic range is impossible. 4. The dichotomies necessitate a switch from materialism to physicalism.   Context: One challenge to the traditional concept of matter as tangible "stuff" came with the rise of field physics in the 19th century. Relativity shows that matter and energy (including the spatially distributed energy of fields) are interchangeable. This enables the ontological view that energy is prima materia and matter is one of its forms. On the other hand, the Standard Model of Particle physics uses quantum field theory to describe all interactions. On this view it could be said that fields are prima materia and the energy is a property of the field.   Score: 0.898665607

Context: Critical appraisal of the film was mixed in the United States. In a lukewarm review for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its potential. Kenneth Turan, reviewing the film for Los Angeles Times, concluded that Spectre "comes off as exhausted and uninspired". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times panned the film as having "nothing surprising" and sacrificing its originality for the sake of box office returns. Forbes' Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing Spectre as "the worst 007 movie in 30 years". Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly viewed Spectre as "an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment", aspiring "to be a serialized sequel" and proving "itself as a Saga". While noting that "[n]othing that happens in Spectre holds up to even minor logical scrutiny", he had "come not to bury Spectre, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie is so strange, so willfully obtuse, that it deserves extra attention." In a positive review Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing "The 24th movie about the British MI6 agent with a license to kill is party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies". Other positive reviews from Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle, gave it a perfect 100 score, stating: “One of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone’s personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person.” Stephen Whitty from the New York Daily News, gave it an 80 grade, saying: “Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn’t leave a huge impression as this film’s “Bond girl,” perhaps it’s because we’ve already met — far too briefly — the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real “Bond woman” since Diana Rigg.” Richard Roeper from the Chicago Sun-Times, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “This is the 24th Bond film and it ranks solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it’s still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.” Michael Phillips over at the Chicago Tribune, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, “Spectre” works best when everyone’s on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes.” Guy Lodge from Variety, gave it a 70 score, stating: “What’s missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of “Skyfall,” as the film sustains its predecessor’s nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent.”   Score: 0.90661025 
Question: What were the factors that led to the expansion of the Burmese empire in the 18th and 19th centuries, and how did it navigate its borders with British India?   Answer: The factors that led to the expansion of the Burmese empire in the 18th and 19th centuries were largely driven by the Chinese threat and the resurgence of Ayutthaya in the east. Faced with these threats, King Bodawpaya sought to expand the Burmese empire by acquiring Arakan (1785), Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817). This expansion created a long ill-defined border with British India, which the Burmese empire navigated by engaging in diplomatic negotiations and treaties with the British. These negotiations and treaties allowed the Burmese empire to maintain its sovereignty while also allowing for trade and other forms of economic exchange with British India.   Context: With Burma preoccupied by the Chinese threat, Ayutthaya recovered its territories by 1770, and went on to capture Lan Na by 1776. Burma and Siam went to war until 1855, but all resulted in a stalemate, exchanging Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Ayutthaya). Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent Ayutthaya in the east, King Bodawpaya turned west, acquiring Arakan (1785), Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817).

Question: What are some notable literary works from the Qing dynasty that contributed to the development of Chinese poetry, short stories, memoirs, and novels?   Answer: Notable literary works from the Qing dynasty that contributed to the development of Chinese poetry, short stories, memoirs, and novels include:  Poetry: Quantangshi and the Three Hundred Tang Poems Short Stories: Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio by Pu Songling Memoirs: Six Chapters of a Floating Life by Shen Fu Novels: Dream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin, The Scholars by Wu Jingzi, and Flowers in the Mirror by Li Ruzhen.   Context: Literature grew to new heights in the Qing period. Poetry continued as a mark of the cultivated gentleman, but women wrote in larger and larger numbers and poets came from all walks of life. The poetry of the Qing dynasty is a lively field of research, being studied (along with the poetry of the Ming dynasty) for its association with Chinese opera, developmental trends of Classical Chinese poetry, the transition to a greater role for vernacular language, and for poetry by women in Chinese culture. The Qing dynasty was a period of much literary collection and criticism, and many of the modern popular versions of Classical Chinese poems were transmitted through Qing dynasty anthologies, such as the Quantangshi and the Three Hundred Tang Poems. Pu Songling brought the short story form to a new level in his Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, published in the mid-18th century, and Shen Fu demonstrated the charm of the informal memoir in Six Chapters of a Floating Life, written in the early 19th century but published only in 1877. The art of the novel reached a pinnacle in Cao Xueqin's Dream of the Red Chamber, but its combination of social commentary and psychological insight were echoed in highly skilled novels such as Wu Jingzi's The Scholars (1750) and Li Ruzhen's Flowers in the Mirror (1827).

Question: What were some of the inspirations for the genuine classic interior in neoclassical architecture?   Answer: The inspirations for the genuine classic interior in neoclassical architecture were the rediscoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum, Le Antichità di Ercolano (The Antiquities of Herculaneum), the classicising interiors of the Baroque, and the "Roman" rooms of William Kent.   Context: Indoors, neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s, with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of Le Antichità di Ercolano (The Antiquities of Herculaneum). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicising interiors of the Baroque, or the most "Roman" rooms of William Kent were based on basilica and temple exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appearance to modern eyes: pedimented window frames turned into gilded mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts.

Question: What is the significance of the Recommended Exposure Index (REI) technique in the 2006 version of the standard, and how does it affect the camera manufacturer's ability to specify EI choices for well-exposed sRGB images?   Answer: The Recommended Exposure Index (REI) technique in the 2006 version of the standard allows the camera manufacturer to specify EI choices arbitrarily, based on their opinion of what EI values produce well-exposed sRGB images at the various sensor sensitivity settings. This gives the manufacturer more control over the EI choices, allowing them to customize the camera model's EI choices to produce the best possible sRGB images. Additionally, this technique is the only one available under the standard for output formats that are not in the sRGB color space, as well as when multi-zone metering is used.   Context: The Recommended Exposure Index (REI) technique, new in the 2006 version of the standard, allows the manufacturer to specify a camera model’s EI choices arbitrarily.

Question: What are some of the key ideas proposed by Thomas Kuhn in his book "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" that challenged the traditional understanding of the history of science and the role of positivism?   Answer: Some of the key ideas proposed by Thomas Kuhn in his book "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" that challenged the traditional understanding of the history of science and the role of positivism include: 1. The evolution of science is in part sociologically determined. 2. Positivism does not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science. 3. The history of science should be seen in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems. 4. Intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science should be taken into account. 5. Scientists of earlier ages are presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons.   Context: The mid 20th century saw a series of studies relying to the role of science in a social context, starting from Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962. It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science. As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science.

Context: In July 2006, a Hezbollah artillery assault on Israel's northern border communities and a cross-border abduction of two Israeli soldiers precipitated the month-long Second Lebanon War. On 6 September 2007, the Israeli Air Force destroyed a nuclear reactor in Syria. In May 2008, Israel confirmed it had been discussing a peace treaty with Syria for a year, with Turkey as a go-between. However, at the end of the year, Israel entered another conflict as a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel collapsed. The Gaza War lasted three weeks and ended after Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire. Hamas announced its own ceasefire, with its own conditions of complete withdrawal and opening of border crossings. Despite neither the rocket launchings nor Israeli retaliatory strikes having completely stopped, the fragile ceasefire remained in order.

Question: What were the reasons behind the strong opposition to daylight saving time in regional and rural areas of Queensland, Australia, despite the support for it in the metropolitan south-east?   Answer: The strong opposition to daylight saving time in regional and rural areas of Queensland, Australia, was likely due to the disruption of daily routines and the disruption of traditional farming practices. Farmers in rural areas rely on the sun to determine when to start and end their work day, and the disruption of the natural light cycle caused by daylight saving time could have caused confusion and disruption to their daily routines. Additionally, the disruption of the natural light cycle could have caused confusion and disruption to traditional farming practices, such as planting and harvesting, which are often timed according to the sun's position in the sky.   Context: In 1992, after a three-year trial of daylight saving in Queensland, Australia, a referendum on daylight saving was held and defeated with a 54.5% 'no' vote – with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan south-east were in favor. In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to US DST. In December 2008, the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating the implementation of a dual-time zone arrangement for Daylight Saving in South East Queensland while the rest of the state maintains standard time. DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland State election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed. On 14 April 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington, introduced the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into Queensland Parliament, calling for a referendum to be held at the next State election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement.

Question: What factors contributed to the dissemination and widespread adoption of Georgian architecture and design styles during the mid-18th century?   Answer: 1. Pattern books and inexpensive suites of engravings that allowed for the dissemination of Georgian styles. 2. The growth of a distinct and trained architectural profession. 3. The apprenticeship system that allowed craftsmen to gain direct experience of the styles. 4. The availability of brick and stone in larger cities and local areas. 5. The influence of authors such as William Halfpenny, whose works were published in both Britain and America.   Context: The period saw the growth of a distinct and trained architectural profession; before the mid-century "the high-sounding title, 'architect' was adopted by anyone who could get away with it". But most buildings were still designed by builders and landlords together, and the wide spread of Georgian architecture, and the Georgian styles of design more generally, came from dissemination through pattern books and inexpensive suites of engravings. This contrasted with earlier styles, which were primarily disseminated among craftsmen through the direct experience of the apprenticeship system. Authors such as the prolific William Halfpenny (active 1723–1755) received editions in America as well as Britain. From the mid-18th century, Georgian styles were assimilated into an architectural vernacular that became part and parcel of the training of every architect, designer, builder, carpenter, mason and plasterer, from Edinburgh to Maryland.

Question: How does a kickback scheme in political corruption involve misappropriated funds and favoritism towards certain companies in bidding processes?   Answer: A kickback scheme in political corruption involves misappropriated funds when an official allocates more money than is deserved to a company in a bidding process. This misappropriation of funds is done in order to receive a kickback payment from the company, which is a portion of the difference between the actual (inflated) payment to the company and the (lower) market-based price that would have been paid had the bidding been competitive. This type of favoritism towards certain companies in bidding processes is a form of corruption that undermines the public trust and can lead to serious consequences.   Context: A kickback is an official's share of misappropriated funds allocated from his or her organization to an organization involved in corrupt bidding. For example, suppose that a politician is in charge of choosing how to spend some public funds. He can give a contract to a company that is not the best bidder, or allocate more than they deserve. In this case, the company benefits, and in exchange for betraying the public, the official receives a kickback payment, which is a portion of the sum the company received.

Question: What evidence does Darwin provide in "On the Origin of Species" to support his proposal of sexual selection as a driving force for sexually dimorphic features in various species?   Answer: Darwin provides evidence in "On the Origin of Species" to support his proposal of sexual selection as a driving force for sexually dimorphic features in various species by analyzing the effectiveness of artificial selection and providing a tree diagram and calculations to demonstrate the divergence of character from original species into new species and genera. He also describes how branches fall off as extinction occurs and new branches form in the great Tree of Life.   Context: Darwin proposes sexual selection, driven by competition between males for mates, to explain sexually dimorphic features such as lion manes, deer antlers, peacock tails, bird songs, and the bright plumage of some male birds. He analysed sexual selection more fully in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could "see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection". Using a tree diagram and calculations, he indicates the "divergence of character" from original species into new species and genera.

Question: What are the challenges in comparing the performance of different guns or missiles in terms of engaging aircraft, considering the various definitions and limitations associated with maximum distance and maximum ceiling?   Answer: The main challenge in comparing the performance of different guns or missiles in terms of engaging aircraft is the lack of a consistent definition. Different definitions of maximum distance and maximum ceiling can lead to different results, making it difficult to accurately compare the performance of different weapons. Additionally, non-ballistic factors such as maximum fuse running time can affect the effective ceiling of heavy AA guns, further complicating the comparison of different weapons.   Context: The maximum distance at which a gun or missile can engage an aircraft is an important figure. However, many different definitions are used but unless the same definition is used, performance of different guns or missiles cannot be compared. For AA guns only the ascending part of the trajectory can be usefully used. One term is 'ceiling', maximum ceiling being the height a projectile would reach if fired vertically, not practically useful in itself as few AA guns are able to fire vertically, and maximum fuse duration may be too short, but potentially useful as a standard to compare different weapons.

Question: What factors contributed to Prince Charles' successful appeal for a classical approach in the development of the former Chelsea Barracks in London, and how does this reflect the ongoing debate between neoclassical and modernist architectural styles?   Answer: Prince Charles' successful appeal for a classical approach in the development of the former Chelsea Barracks in London was likely due to a combination of factors. Firstly, the neoclassical style has a long history of being associated with grandeur and elegance, which likely appealed to the Qatari Royal family. Secondly, the neoclassical style is often seen as a more traditional approach to architecture, which may have been more in line with the Qatari Royal family's preferences. Finally, the neoclassical style is often seen as a more conservative approach to architecture, which may have been more in line with the Qatari Royal family's values. This reflects the ongoing debate between neoclassical and modernist architectural styles, as neoclassical architecture is often seen as a more traditional and conservative approach, while modernist architecture is often seen as a more progressive and innovative approach. This debate is often seen as a clash between the old and the new, and between the traditional and the modern.   Context: In Britain a number of architects are active in the neoclassical style. Two new university Libraries, Quinlan Terry's Maitland Robinson Library at Downing College and ADAM Architecture's Sackler Library illustrate that the approach taken can range from the traditional, in the former case, to the unconventional, in the latter case. Recently, Prince Charles came under controversy for promoting a classically designed development on the land of the former Chelsea Barracks in London. Writing to the Qatari Royal family (who were funding the development through the property development company Qatari Diar) he condemned the accepted modernist plans, instead advocating a classical approach. His appeal was met with success and the plans were withdrawn. A new design by architecture house Dixon Jones is currently being drafted.   Score: 0.88367641

Question: What factors have contributed to the decline in the number of public houses in the United Kingdom, particularly in smaller villages?   Answer: The main factors that have contributed to the decline in the number of public houses in the United Kingdom, particularly in smaller villages, are the introduction of new licensing laws, the rise of food-focused establishments, and the emergence of micro-brewers. The new licensing laws prevented new beer houses from being created, while existing ones were allowed to continue. This led to many of them applying for the new licences and becoming full pubs. At the same time, many pubs have been converted to establishments that focus on providing seating facilities for the consumption of food, rather than a venue for members of the local community to meet and drink. Additionally, the emergence of micro-brewers has allowed for more competition in the beer market, leading to a decrease in the number of public houses.

Answer: Significant events in Madonna's personal and professional life around the time of the release of her book "Life with My Sister Madonna" include: friction between Madonna and her brother due to the unsolicited publication of the book; problems between Madonna and her husband Guy Ritchie, with the media reporting that they were on the verge of separation; Madonna filing for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences; Madonna's attempt to adopt a child from Malawi, which was initially rejected due to her not being a resident of the country; the Supreme Court of Malawi granting Madonna the right to adopt a child; the release of her third greatest-hits album, Celebration; and her appearance at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to speak in tribute to Michael Jackson.   Context: Life with My Sister Madonna, a book by Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted at number two on The New York Times bestseller list. The book caused some friction between Madonna and her brother, because of the unsolicited publication. Problems also arose between Madonna and Ritchie, with the media reporting that they were on the verge of separation. Ultimately, Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences, which was finalized in December 2008. She decided to adopt from Malawi. The country's High Court initially approved the adoption of Chifundo "Mercy" James; however, the application was rejected because Madonna was not a resident of the country. Madonna appealed, and on June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi granted Madonna the right to adopt Mercy James. She also released Celebration, her third greatest-hits album and final release with Warner. It contained the new songs "Celebration" and "Revolver" along with 34 hits spanning her career.

Question: What factors contributed to the relatively high prices of the iMac G4 compared to the preceding iMac G3, and how did this impact Macintosh desktop sales?   Answer: The iMac G4 was considerably more expensive than the preceding iMac G3 due to the higher cost of LCD technology at the time. This higher cost meant that the iMac G4 was approaching the price of laptops, which had higher resolution LCD screens and were portable. Windows PC manufacturers were also able to offer desktop configurations with LCD flat panel monitors at prices comparable to the eMac and at much lower cost than the iMac G4. This meant that Macintosh desktop sales never reached the market share attained by the previous iMac G3.   Context: Starting in 2002, Apple moved to eliminate CRT displays from its product line as part of aesthetic design and space-saving measures with the iMac G4. However, the new iMac with its flexible LCD flat-panel monitor was considerably more expensive on its debut than the preceding iMac G3, largely due to the higher cost of the LCD technology at the time. In order to keep the Macintosh affordable for the education market and due to obsolescence of the iMac G3, Apple created the eMac in April 2002 as the intended successor; however the eMac's CRT made it relatively bulky and somewhat outdated, while its all-in-one construction meant it could not be expanded to meet consumer demand for larger monitors. The iMac G4's relatively high prices were approaching that of laptops which were portable and had higher resolution LCD screens. Meanwhile, Windows PC manufacturers could offer desktop configurations with LCD flat panel monitors at prices comparable to the eMac and at much lower cost than the iMac G4. The flop of the Power Mac G4 Cube, along with the more expensive iMac G4 and heavy eMac, meant that Macintosh desktop sales never reached the market share attained by the previous iMac G3. For the next half-decade while Macintosh sales held steady, it would instead be the iPod portable music player and iTunes music download service that would drive Apple's sales growth.

Question: What were the factors that contributed to the conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients during the financial crisis of 2007-08?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients during the financial crisis of 2007-08 were the global glut in investment capital and the incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. The global glut in investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, which meant that asset managers had to choose between investing in assets with lower returns or returning funds to clients. This created a conflict of interest between the asset managers and their clients, as the asset managers had an incentive to continue to invest in over-priced (under-yielding) investments in order to maintain their assets under management.   Context: Moreover, a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients, combined with a global glut in investment capital, led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets. Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, in order to maintain their assets under management. This choice was supported by a "plausible deniability" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early "vintages" of subprime loans was so low.

Question: What is the significance of Strasbourg's collection of incunabula and how has it evolved over time?   Answer: Strasbourg's collection of incunabula is significant because it is one of the earliest centers of book-printing in Europe. The collection was destroyed in 1870, but has since been reassembled from scratch. Today, Strasbourg's different public and institutional libraries display a sizable total number of incunabula, distributed among five different libraries. This demonstrates the evolution of the collection over time, as it has been rebuilt and expanded to include a larger number of documents.

Question: How did the economic problems and rising crime rates in New York City in the 1970s impact its population growth and overall development?   Answer: The economic problems and rising crime rates in New York City in the 1970s had a negative impact on its population growth and overall development. The job losses due to industrial restructuring caused a decrease in economic opportunities, which led to an increase in crime rates. This, in turn, caused people to leave the city, resulting in a decrease in population growth. The financial industry resurgence in the 1980s helped to improve the city's economic health, but the crime rate continued to increase until the mid-1990s. It was only then that the revised police strategies, improved economic opportunities, gentrification, and influx of new residents helped to reduce the crime rate and spur population growth and overall development.   Context: In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates. While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s. By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America.

Context: The Kingdom of Pontus was a Hellenistic kingdom on the southern coast of the Black Sea. It was founded by Mithridates I in 291 BC and lasted until its conquest by the Roman Republic in 63 BC. Despite being ruled by a dynasty which was a descendant of the Persian Achaemenid Empire it became hellenized due to the influence of the Greek cities on the Black Sea and its neighboring kingdoms.

Question: What are the key characteristics and beliefs that make Theravada Buddhism the oldest surviving Buddhist school, and how does it differ from other branches of Buddhism?   Answer: Theravada Buddhism is the oldest surviving Buddhist school because it is the most conservative and closest to the original teachings of the Buddha. It is based on the Pali Canon, which is the oldest version of Buddhist scripture, and emphasizes rationality and scientific principles. It is distinct from other branches of Buddhism in that it does not accept later modifications to the Vinaya, the code of monastic discipline, and instead follows the teachings of the Sthaviras, a small group of "elderly members" who broke away from the majority Mahāsāṃghika during the Second Buddhist council. Theravada Buddhism also emphasizes the importance of individual effort and self-reliance in achieving enlightenment, while other branches of Buddhism may emphasize the importance of rituals and other external practices.   Context: Theravada ("Doctrine of the Elders", or "Ancient Doctrine") is the oldest surviving Buddhist school. It is relatively conservative, and generally closest to early Buddhism. The name Theravāda comes from the ancestral Sthāvirīya, one of the early Buddhist schools, from which the Theravadins claim descent. After unsuccessfully trying to modify the Vinaya, a small group of "elderly members", i.e. sthaviras, broke away from the majority Mahāsāṃghika during the Second Buddhist council, giving rise to the Sthavira sect.

Question: What were the differences in the effectiveness of the British and French bombardment during the Crimean War?   Answer: The British bombardment was more effective than the French bombardment during the Crimean War. The British had larger caliber guns, while the French had smaller caliber guns. This allowed the British to cause more damage and inflict more casualties on the Russian forces. Additionally, the British were more prepared and ready to attack on the day of the bombardment, while the French wanted to postpone the attack. This allowed the British to gain an advantage in the battle.

Question: How does antenna tuning work to cancel reactance and achieve a purely resistive impedance at the antenna terminals?   Answer: Antenna tuning works by either physically trimming the antenna to obtain a pure resistance, or by adding a series inductance or parallel capacitance to cancel any residual capacitative or inductive reactance, respectively. This allows the antenna to have a purely resistive feedpoint impedance, which can then be matched to the transmission line. In some cases, the resonant frequency of the antenna can be adjusted by using a shorter antenna at a lower frequency than its resonant frequency, which is known as electrical lengthening.   Context: Antenna tuning generally refers to cancellation of any reactance seen at the antenna terminals, leaving only a resistive impedance which might or might not be exactly the desired impedance (that of the transmission line). Although an antenna may be designed to have a purely resistive feedpoint impedance (such as a dipole 97% of a half wavelength long) this might not be exactly true at the frequency that it is eventually used at. In some cases the physical length of the antenna can be "trimmed" to obtain a pure resistance.

Question: What were the implications and reactions of the Han Chinese to Dorgon's haircutting order during the Qing dynasty, and how did it challenge traditional Confucian values?   Answer: The Han Chinese had a strong negative reaction to Dorgon's haircutting order during the Qing dynasty. The order was seen as a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that "a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged." This order triggered strong resistance to Qing rule in Jiangnan and massive killing of ethnic Han Chinese. It was Han Chinese defectors who carried out massacres against people refusing to wear the queue. Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who had served the Ming but surrendered to the Qing, ordered his Han troops to carry out three separate massacres in the city of Jiading within a month, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Han Chinese Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Han Chinese Qing army led by the Han Chinese Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐), who had been ordered to "fill the city with corpses before you sheathe your swords," massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. This order was seen as a violation of traditional Confucian values and a sign of Qing authority, and it was met with strong resistance and violence from the Han Chinese.   Context: Dorgon's controversial July 1645 edict (the "haircutting order") forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: "To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair." To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that "a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged." Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore it in the form of a top-knot. The order triggered strong resistance to Qing rule in Jiangnan and massive killing of ethnic Han Chinese. It was Han Chinese defectors who carried out massacres against people refusing to wear the queue.. Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who had served the Ming but surrendered to the Qing, ordered his Han troops to carry out three separate massacres in the city of Jiading within a month, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. At the end of the third massacre, there was hardly any living person left in this city. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Han Chinese Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Han Chinese Qing army led by the Han Chinese Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐), who had been ordered to "fill the city with corpses before you sheathe your swords," massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. The queue was the only aspect of Manchu culture which the Qing forced on the common Han population. The Qing required people serving as officials to wear Manchu clothing, but allowed non-official Han civilians to continue wearing Hanfu (Han clothing).   Score: 0.896499038 
Question: What were some of the fields in the 19th century that utilized comparative methods and suspected similarities between animals, languages, and folkways?   Answer: The fields in the 19th century that utilized comparative methods and suspected similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were anatomy, linguistics, and Ethnology.   Context: Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy, linguistics, and Ethnology, making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then. For them, the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild.   Score: 0.897814453 
Question: How does the disregard for wildlife by the Iranian Parliament, as evidenced by passing laws and regulations that exploit mines and approve large development projects without considering their impact on wildlife habitats, contribute to the serious threats against Iran's biodiversity?   Answer: The disregard for wildlife by the Iranian Parliament contributes to the serious threats against Iran's biodiversity by allowing for the exploitation of mines and the approval of large national development projects without considering their impact on wildlife habitats. This disregard for wildlife can lead to the destruction of habitats, the disruption of ecosystems, and the displacement of species, all of which can have a negative impact on the country's biodiversity.   Context: At least 74 species of Iranian wildlife are on the red list of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a sign of serious threats against the country’s biodiversity. The Iranian Parliament has been showing disregard for wildlife by passing laws and regulations such as the act that lets the Ministry of Industries and Mines exploit mines without the involvement of the Department of Environment, and by approving large national development projects without demanding comprehensive study of their impact on wildlife habitats.

Question: What were the main challenges that hindered the use of sign language via videotelephony in the past, and how were they overcome in the 1990s?   Answer: The main challenges that hindered the use of sign language via videotelephony in the past were the difficulty of its use over slow analogue copper phone lines, coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN (data) phone lines. These factors were largely overcome in the 1990s with the introduction of more efficient video codecs and the advent of lower cost high-speed ISDN data and IP (Internet) services.   Context: One of the first demonstrations of the ability for telecommunications to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when AT&T's videophone (trademarked as the "Picturephone") was introduced to the public at the 1964 New York World's Fair –two deaf users were able to communicate freely with each other between the fair and another city. Various universities and other organizations, including British Telecom's Martlesham facility, have also conducted extensive research on signing via videotelephony. The use of sign language via videotelephony was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow analogue copper phone lines, coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN (data) phone lines. Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient video codecs and the advent of lower cost high-speed ISDN data and IP (Internet) services in the 1990s.   Score: 0.889559031

Question: What were some of the heresies and schisms that preoccupied Athanasius during his 45-year-long episcopate?   Answer: Some of the heresies and schisms that preoccupied Athanasius during his 45-year-long episcopate included Arianism, the belief that Jesus was not fully divine, and various other forms of Gnosticism. He also had to contend with schisms within the Church, such as the Meletian Schism, which was a dispute over the legitimacy of certain bishops.   Context: Athanasius's episcopate began on 9 May 328 as the Alexandrian Council elected Athanasius to succeed the aged Alexander. That council also denounced various heresies and schisms, many of which continued to preoccupy his 45-year-long episcopate (c. 8 June 328 – 2 May 373). Patriarch Athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different Roman Emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which Athanasius fled Alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life. This gave rise to the expression "Athanasius contra mundum" or "Athanasius against the world". However, during his first years as bishop, Athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of Egypt and Libya. He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including Pachomius, which proved very valuable to him over the years. Shortly thereafter, Athanasius became occupied with the theological disputes against Arians within the Byzantine Empire that would occupy much of his life.   Score: 0.880677938

Question: How did broadcasters adapt to the diverse recording characteristics of different sources, and what steps were taken to standardize recording standards within the National Association of Broadcasters?   Answer: Broadcasters adapted to the diverse recording characteristics of different sources by making daily adjustments to their broadcasts. To standardize recording standards within the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), later known as the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (NARTB), efforts were started in 1942. In 1949, the NAB issued recording standards for laterally and vertically cut records, principally transcriptions. A number of 78 rpm record producers as well as early LP makers also cut their records to the NAB/NARTB lateral standard.

Question: What were the reasons behind the British and American diplomats' concern for the security of Iran (Persia) that led to the use of the term "Middle East" in international affairs?   Answer: The British and American diplomats were concerned about the security of Iran (Persia) due to the increasing presence of the Ottoman Empire in the region. The Ottoman Empire had been expanding its influence in the region, and the British and American diplomats wanted to ensure that Iran (Persia) was not threatened by the Ottoman Empire's growing power. This led to the use of the term "Middle East" to refer to the region as a whole, as a way to emphasize the importance of the region in international affairs.   Context: The use of the term Middle East as a region of international affairs apparently began in British and American diplomatic circles quite independently of each other over concern for the security of the same country: Iran, then known to the west as Persia.

Question: What factors contribute to the increasing outsourcing of risks related to fundamental research in the pharmaceutical industry and how does it reshape the industry ecosystem?   Answer: The increasing outsourcing of risks related to fundamental research in the pharmaceutical industry is largely driven by the high costs associated with the long time needed for discovery, development, and approval of pharmaceuticals. This cost can accumulate to nearly half the total expense, making it difficult for major pharmaceutical multinationals to invest in fundamental research. As a result, these companies are increasingly outsourcing risks related to fundamental research to biotechnology companies, which has reshaped the industry ecosystem and redefined overall strategies. This shift has allowed biotechnology companies to play an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry, as they are better equipped to handle the risks associated with fundamental research.   Context: Some of these estimates also take into account the opportunity cost of investing capital many years before revenues are realized (see Time-value of money). Because of the very long time needed for discovery, development, and approval of pharmaceuticals, these costs can accumulate to nearly half the total expense. A direct consequence within the pharmaceutical industry value chain is that major pharmaceutical multinationals tend to increasingly outsource risks related to fundamental research, which somewhat reshapes the industry ecosystem with biotechnology companies playing an increasingly important role, and overall strategies being redefined accordingly. Some approved drugs, such as those based on re-formulation of an existing active ingredient (also referred to as Line-extensions) are much less expensive to develop.   Score: 0.857358396

Question: What is the significance of the numerical "Miami Grid" in the city's road system and how does it affect street addresses and location descriptions?   Answer: The numerical "Miami Grid" is a system of organizing the city's roads based on two main streets, Flagler Street and Miami Avenue. Flagler Street forms the east-west baseline and Miami Avenue forms the north-south meridian, with the corner of the two streets being in the middle of Downtown. This grid system is used to assign numerical addresses to streets, with all streets north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue having "NW" in their address. This system also affects the size of the quadrants, with the "NW" and "SW" quadrants being much larger than the "SE" and "NE" quadrants due to the point of origin being close to the coast. This numerical grid system is used by locals to describe locations and street addresses, with the number being more commonly used than the name of the street.   Context: Miami's road system is based along the numerical "Miami Grid" where Flagler Street forms the east-west baseline and Miami Avenue forms the north-south meridian. The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of Downtown in front of the Downtown Macy's (formerly the Burdine's headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have "NW" in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown, which is close to the coast, therefore, the "NW" and "SW" quadrants are much larger than the "SE" and "NE" quadrants.

Question: What is the difference between phonology and phonetics, according to Nikolai Trubetzkoy and Saussure's distinction between langue and parole?   Answer: According to Nikolai Trubetzkoy and Saussure's distinction between langue and parole, the difference between phonology and phonetics is that phonology is the study of sound pertaining to the system of language, while phonetics is the study of sound pertaining to the act of speech.   Context: The word phonology comes from the Greek φωνή, phōnḗ, "voice, sound," and the suffix -logy (which is from Greek λόγος, lógos, "word, speech, subject of discussion"). Definitions of the term vary. Nikolai Trubetzkoy in Grundzüge der Phonologie (1939) defines phonology as "the study of sound pertaining to the system of language," as opposed to phonetics, which is "the study of sound pertaining to the act of speech" (the distinction between language and speech being basically Saussure's distinction between langue and parole). More recently, Lass (1998) writes that phonology refers broadly to the subdiscipline of linguistics concerned with the sounds of language, while in more narrow terms, "phonology proper is concerned with the function, behavior and organization of sounds as linguistic items." According to Clark et al. (2007), it means the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken human language, or the field of linguistics studying this use.   Score: 0.846771181 
Question: What factors contribute to the subjective perception of pitch in music, and how does it relate to the objective attribute of frequency?   Answer: The subjective perception of pitch in music is largely determined by the frequency of the sound waves. The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch. However, other factors such as the timbre of the sound, the intensity of the sound, and the context in which the sound is heard can also contribute to the subjective perception of pitch. Frequency is an objective attribute that can be measured, but the subjective perception of pitch is based on the individual's interpretation of the sound.   Context: Pitch is an auditory sensation in which a listener assigns musical tones to relative positions on a musical scale based primarily on their perception of the frequency of vibration. Pitch is closely related to frequency, but the two are not equivalent. Frequency is an objective, scientific attribute that can be measured. Pitch is each person's subjective perception of a sound, which cannot be directly measured. However, this does not necessarily mean that most people won't agree on which notes are higher and lower.

Question: What are some examples of films and television programs that prominently feature airports and how do they contribute to the overall narrative?   Answer: Films and television programs that prominently feature airports often use them to create a sense of adventure, suspense, and mystery. For example, The Terminal is a film about a man who becomes stranded in an airport terminal and must survive on the food and shelter provided by the airport. In Airplane!, airports are used to create a comedic atmosphere as the characters attempt to land a plane in the midst of a chaotic situation. In Lost, airports are used to introduce the characters and set the stage for the show's mysterious plot. In The Amazing Race, airports are used to create a sense of competition and adventure as teams race around the world. In America's Next Top Model, airports are used to introduce the contestants and set the stage for the show's fashion-focused narrative. Finally, in Good Will Hunting, airports are used to symbolize journeys and the characters' growth.   Context: Airports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is The Terminal, a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as The V.I.P.s, Airplane!, Airport (1970), Die Hard 2, Soul Plane, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, Home Alone, Liar Liar, Passenger 57, Final Destination (2000), Unaccompanied Minors, Catch Me If You Can, Rendition and The Langoliers.

Question: What factors contributed to the formation and growth of separate black Baptist churches and associations in the late 18th century and after the American Civil War?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the formation and growth of separate black Baptist churches and associations in the late 18th century and after the American Civil War were the desire for freedom from white supervision, the support of black missionary work, and the opposition to slavery in the northern states. The Consolidated American Baptist Convention, formed from black Baptists of the South and West, helped southern associations set up black state conventions. The National Baptist Convention was formed in 1895, uniting two other national black conventions. The northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery, and the Home Mission Society refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary in 1844. These factors all contributed to the formation and growth of separate black Baptist churches and associations.   Context: As early as the late 18th century, black Baptists began to organize separate churches, associations and mission agencies, especially in the northern states. Not only did blacks set up some independent congregations in the South before the American Civil War, freedmen quickly separated from white congregations and associations after the war. They wanted to be free of white supervision. In 1866 the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, formed from black Baptists of the South and West, helped southern associations set up black state conventions, which they did in Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky. In 1880 black state conventions united in the national Foreign Mission Convention, to support black Baptist missionary work. Two other national black conventions were formed, and in 1895 they united as the National Baptist Convention. This organization later went through its own changes, spinning off other conventions. It is the largest black religious organization and the second largest Baptist organization in the world. Baptists are numerically most dominant in the Southeast.

Question: What were the major consequences of the Seven Years' War for Prussia and Russia?   Answer: The major consequences of the Seven Years' War for Prussia and Russia were that Prussia emerged as a great power whose importance could no longer be challenged, and Frederick the Great's personal reputation was enormously enhanced. Russia, on the other hand, made one great invisible gain from the war: the elimination of French influence in Poland. The First Partition of Poland (1772) was to be a Russo-Prussian transaction, with Austria only reluctantly involved and with France simply ignored.   Context: Prussia emerged from the war as a great power whose importance could no longer be challenged. Frederick the Great’s personal reputation was enormously enhanced, as his debt to fortune (Russia’s volte-face after Elizabeth’s death) and to the British subsidy were soon forgotten while the memory of his energy and his military genius was strenuously kept alive.

Question: What historical evidence supports the claim that the Sclaveni lived in environments characterized by swamps, forests, rivers, lakes, and marshes during the 6th century?   Answer: Jordanes, a 6th-century source, refers to the Sclaveni living among nearly impenetrable forests, rivers, lakes, and marshes. Additionally, Byzantine historiographers under Justinian I (527–565), such as Procopius of Caesarea, Jordanes and Theophylact Simocatta describe tribes of the Sclaveni and Antes emerging from the area of the Carpathian Mountains, the lower Danube and the Black Sea, invading the Danubian provinces of the Eastern Empire. This suggests that the Sclaveni lived in environments characterized by swamps, forests, rivers, lakes, and marshes during the 6th century.

Question: What are the main focuses of educational psychology and how does it differ from school psychology?   Answer: The main focuses of educational psychology are the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as gifted children and those with specific disabilities. Educational psychology is concerned with how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. School psychology is a field of practice that focuses on the mental health and educational needs of students in school settings. School psychologists are typically trained to assess and intervene in mental health and learning issues, and to provide consultation and support to teachers, parents, and administrators. School psychologists may also provide direct services to students, such as individual or group counseling.   Context: Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. Although the terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as educational psychologists, whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as school psychologists.

Question: What were the main factors that led to the curtailment of military expansion during Hisham's reign in the Umayyad Caliphate?   Answer: The main factors that led to the curtailment of military expansion during Hisham's reign in the Umayyad Caliphate were the failure of the last siege of Constantinople, a major defeat in the Battle of Akroinon, and the reform of the Diwan of Umar, which resulted in pensions only being paid to those who participated in battle.   Context: The final son of Abd al-Malik to become caliph was Hisham (724–43), whose long and eventful reign was above all marked by the curtailment of military expansion. Hisham established his court at Resafa in northern Syria, which was closer to the Byzantine border than Damascus, and resumed hostilities against the Byzantines, which had lapsed following the failure of the last siege of Constantinople. The new campaigns resulted in a number of successful raids into Anatolia, but also in a major defeat (the Battle of Akroinon), and did not lead to any significant territorial expansion.

Question: What are the key characteristics of Palladian architecture as described in the provided context?   Answer: The key characteristics of Palladian architecture as described in the provided context are a severe lack of ornamentation, a main block that follows Palladio's dictates closely, and elevated wings of farm buildings.   Context: At the forefront of the new school of design was the aristocratic "architect earl", Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington; in 1729, he and William Kent, designed Chiswick House. This House was a reinterpretation of Palladio's Villa Capra, but purified of 16th century elements and ornament. This severe lack of ornamentation was to be a feature of the Palladianism. In 1734 William Kent and Lord Burlington designed one of England's finest examples of Palladian architecture with Holkham Hall in Norfolk. The main block of this house followed Palladio's dictates quite closely, but Palladio's low, often detached, wings of farm buildings were elevated in significance.   Score: 0.852872491 
Question: What were some of the significant ecological changes and adaptations that occurred during the Early Cretaceous period?   Answer: Some of the significant ecological changes and adaptations that occurred during the Early Cretaceous period include: the expansion of seaways, the decline and extinction of sauropods (except in South America), the evolution of mosasaurs to replace ichthyosaurs as the head of the seas, the evolution of island-hopping dinosaurs to cope with coastal shallows and small islands, the spread of Iguanodon to every continent, the return of seasons and the seasonal cooling of the poles, the last stronghold for large amphibians, the evolution of larger pterosaurs, and the migration of some dinosaurs to the polar forests during summer.   Context: The climatic changes of the late Jurassic and Cretaceous provided for further adaptive radiation. The Jurassic was the height of archosaur diversity, and the first birds and eutherian mammals also appeared. Angiosperms radiated sometime in the early Cretaceous, first in the tropics, but the even temperature gradient allowed them to spread toward the poles throughout the period. By the end of the Cretaceous, angiosperms dominated tree floras in many areas, although some evidence suggests that biomass was still dominated by cycad and ferns until after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction.

Question: What are the major dimensions of communication, and how do they contribute to the overall impact of a message on its target audience?   Answer: The major dimensions of communication are Message (what type of things are communicated), Source/Emisor/Sender/Encoder (by whom), Form (in which form), Channel (through which medium), Destination/Receiver/Target/Decoder (to whom), and Receiver. These dimensions contribute to the overall impact of a message on its target audience by providing the necessary information for the message to be understood and interpreted correctly. The message must be clear and concise, the source must be reliable, the form must be appropriate for the audience, the channel must be effective, and the destination must be appropriate. Additionally, the receiver must be able to interpret the message correctly. All of these factors contribute to the overall impact of a message on its target audience.   Context: Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emisor / sender / encoder (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which medium), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. Wilbur Schram (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message. Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make messages that are sent towards a destination.

Question: What were some of the key factors that influenced the development of Presbyterianism as a distinct movement during the Protestant Reformation?   Answer: The key factors that influenced the development of Presbyterianism as a distinct movement during the Protestant Reformation were the teachings of French theologian John Calvin, the work of John Knox, and the adoption of the Scots Confession as the creed of the Scottish Kingdom.   Context: Presbyterian history is part of the history of Christianity, but the beginning of Presbyterianism as a distinct movement occurred during the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. As the Catholic Church resisted the reformers, several different theological movements splintered from the Church and bore different denominations. Presbyterianism was especially influenced by the French theologian John Calvin, who is credited with the development of Reformed theology, and the work of John Knox, a Scotsman who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland and brought his teachings back to Scotland. The Presbyterian church traces its ancestry back primarily to England and Scotland. In August 1560 the Parliament of Scotland adopted the Scots Confession as the creed of the Scottish Kingdom. In December 1560, the First Book of Discipline was published, outlining important doctrinal issues but also establishing regulations for church government, including the creation of ten ecclesiastical districts with appointed superintendents which later became known as presbyteries.

Question: What are the various roles that birds play in religion and mythology across different civilizations and cultures?   Answer: Birds play a variety of roles in religion and mythology across different civilizations and cultures. In some religions, birds may serve as messengers or priests and leaders for a deity, such as in the Cult of Makemake. In ancient Italy, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds. Birds may also serve as religious symbols, as when Jonah embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves. Birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India. In some cultures, birds are believed to mark the existence of a portal between earthly and spiritual realms, and to transform themselves into other animals.   Context: Birds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology. In religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity, such as in the Cult of Makemake, in which the Tangata manu of Easter Island served as chiefs or as attendants, as in the case of Hugin and Munin, the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the Norse god Odin. In several civilizations of ancient Italy, particularly Etruscan and Roman religion, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds while the "auspex" (from which the word "auspicious" is derived) watched their activities to foretell events. They may also serve as religious symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: יוֹנָה, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves. Birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India. In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms.

Question: How did the design of the NES controllers differ from the Famicom, and what impact did this difference have on certain localized games like The Legend of Zelda?   Answer: The NES controllers featured two custom 7-pin ports on the front of the console, while the Famicom controllers featured a microphone and START and SELECT buttons. This difference had an impact on certain localized games like The Legend of Zelda, which required the use of the Famicom microphone in order to kill certain enemies, but the NES lacked the hardware to do so.   Context: The NES dropped the hardwired controllers, instead featuring two custom 7-pin ports on the front of the console. Also in contrast to the Famicom, the controllers included with the NES were identical to each other—the second controller lacked the microphone that was present on the Famicom model and possessed the same START and SELECT buttons as the primary controller.

Question: What were the challenges faced by Henry II of England in maintaining the Angevin Empire and ensuring the continuity of his dynasty after his death?   Answer: Henry II of England faced a number of challenges in maintaining the Angevin Empire and ensuring the continuity of his dynasty after his death. The disparate parts of the empire each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures, making it difficult to maintain a unified empire. Additionally, the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time. Furthermore, the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England, making it difficult to ensure the continuity of his dynasty. Finally, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet, making it difficult to maintain control of the empire.   Context: John was born to Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine on 24 December 1166. Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard—Anjou, Normandy and England—and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany. Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France, in addition to being the former wife of Louis VII of France. The result was the Angevin Empire, named after Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou and, more specifically, its seat in Angers.[nb 2] The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures. As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time. It was unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry's death. Although the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England. Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death. To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.   Score: 0.863905132

Answer: Examples of professional wrestlers who have become famous for winning matches via submission include Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Ric Flair, Bret Hart, Kurt Angle, Ken Shamrock, Dean Malenko, Chris Benoit, and Tazz.   Context: Submission was initially a large factor in professional wrestling, but following the decline of the submission-oriented catch-as-catch-can style from mainstream professional wrestling, the submission largely faded until the rise of the legitimate sport of mixed martial arts. Despite this, some wrestlers, such as Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Ric Flair, Bret Hart, Kurt Angle, Ken Shamrock, Dean Malenko, Chris Benoit, and Tazz, became famous for winning matches via submission. A wrestler with a signature submission technique is portrayed as better at applying the hold, making it more painful or more difficult to get out of than others who use it, or can be falsely credited as inventing the hold (such as when Tazz popularized the kata ha jime judo choke in pro wrestling as the "Tazzmission").

Question: What evidence supports the existence of hypothetical Old Iranian languages and unattested languages in the context of Iranian languages?   Answer: The evidence that supports the existence of hypothetical Old Iranian languages and unattested languages in the context of Iranian languages includes the impact they had on neighbouring languages, foreign references to languages, and the recording of vocabulary by Herodotus. Additionally, the presence of a "Median" substrate in some of Old Persian's vocabulary is also evidence of the existence of these languages.   Context: In addition to Old Persian and Avestan, which are the only directly attested Old Iranian languages, all Middle Iranian languages must have had a predecessor "Old Iranian" form of that language, and thus can all be said to have had an (at least hypothetical) "Old" form. Such hypothetical Old Iranian languages include Carduchi (the hypothetical predecessor to Kurdish) and Old Parthian. Additionally, the existence of unattested languages can sometimes be inferred from the impact they had on neighbouring languages. Such transfer is known to have occurred for Old Persian, which has (what is called) a "Median" substrate in some of its vocabulary. Also, foreign references to languages can also provide a hint to the existence of otherwise unattested languages, for example through toponyms/ethnonyms or in the recording of vocabulary, as Herodotus did for what he called "Scythian".

Answer: The main reason for the association of miraculous powers with Virgil's tomb during the Middle Ages and the subsequent pilgrimages and veneration was the belief that Virgil was a great magician and prophet. This belief was based on the interpretation of Eclogues 4, which described the birth of a boy ushering in a golden age, as a prediction of Jesus' birth. Additionally, Virgil's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination in the Sortes Vergilianae. These beliefs and practices led to the veneration of Virgil's tomb and the belief that it held miraculous powers.   Context: In the Middle Ages, Virgil's reputation was such that it inspired legends associating him with magic and prophecy. From at least the 3rd century, Christian thinkers interpreted Eclogues 4, which describes the birth of a boy ushering in a golden age, as a prediction of Jesus' birth. As such, Virgil came to be seen on a similar level as the Hebrew prophets of the Bible as one who had heralded Christianity.   Score: 0.860863924 
Question: What impact did the removal of the Laemmles have on Universal Studios' production budgets and the retention of talented individuals like William Wyler and Margaret Sullavan?   Answer: The removal of the Laemmles had a significant impact on Universal Studios' production budgets and the retention of talented individuals like William Wyler and Margaret Sullavan. Standard Capital's J. Cheever Cowdin instituted severe cuts in production budgets, which resulted in the loss of big ambitions and the departure of the talented individuals that Universal had been cultivating.   Context: Universal's forays into high-quality production spelled the end of the Laemmle era at the studio. Taking on the task of modernizing and upgrading a film conglomerate in the depths of the depression was risky, and for a time Universal slipped into receivership. The theater chain was scrapped, but Carl, Jr. held fast to distribution, studio and production operations.   Score: 0.869491339 
Question: How has the legislation passed in 1968 impacted the term limits and appointment process for FBI Directors?   Answer: The legislation passed in 1968 has impacted the term limits and appointment process for FBI Directors by specifying a 10-year limit, a maximum of two 5-year terms, for future FBI Directors, as well as requiring Senate confirmation of appointees. This legislation did not apply to J. Edgar Hoover, the longest-serving director, as he was the incumbent at the time, but it does apply to all of his successors.   Context: FBI Directors are appointed by the President of the United States. They must be confirmed by the United States Senate and serve a term of office of five years, with a maximum of ten years, if reappointed, unless they resign or are fired by the President before their term ends. J. Edgar Hoover, appointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1924, was by far the longest-serving director, serving until his death in 1972. In 1968, Congress passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act Pub.L. 90–351, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat. 197 that specified a 10-year limit, a maximum of two 5-year terms, for future FBI Directors, as well as requiring Senate confirmation of appointees.

Question: What were some of the challenges Muammar Gaddafi faced while learning English and how did he overcome them?   Answer: Muammar Gaddafi faced several challenges while learning English, including difficulty adjusting to the culture of England and being racially insulted by British Army officers. He also had difficulty understanding the language and mastering voice procedure. However, he was able to overcome these challenges by displaying a firm command of voice procedure and by reading and playing football, which helped him to become more confident and proud of his own values and ideals.   Context: The Bovington signal course's director reported that Gaddafi successfully overcame problems learning English, displaying a firm command of voice procedure. Noting that Gaddafi's favourite hobbies were reading and playing football, he thought him an "amusing officer, always cheerful, hard-working, and conscientious." Gaddafi disliked England, claiming British Army officers racially insulted him and finding it difficult adjusting to the country's culture; asserting his Arab identity in London, he walked around Piccadilly wearing traditional Libyan robes. He later related that while he travelled to England believing it more advanced than Libya, he returned home "more confident and proud of our values, ideals and social character."

Question: What were the advantages and disadvantages of the F-86 Sabre and MiG-15 fighters during the Korean War?   Answer: The F-86 Sabre had the advantage of having a slightly lower service ceiling of 42,000 feet (13,000 m) and being armed with six .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns, which were range adjusted by radar gunsights. This allowed the F-86 to engage in dogfights at lower altitudes and with greater accuracy. The F-86 also had better turning and diving capabilities than the MiG-15. The MiG-15 had the advantage of having a very high service ceiling of 50,000 feet (15,000 m) and carrying very heavy weaponry: one 37 mm cannon and two 23 mm cannons. This allowed the MiG-15 to dive past the fighter escort of P-80 Shooting Stars and F9F Panthers and reach and destroy the U.S. heavy bombers. However, the MiG-15 had the disadvantage of having a slower climb rate than the F-86 Sabre.   Context: The USAF countered the MiG-15 by sending over three squadrons of its most capable fighter, the F-86 Sabre. These arrived in December 1950. The MiG was designed as a bomber interceptor. It had a very high service ceiling—50,000 feet (15,000 m) and carried very heavy weaponry: one 37 mm cannon and two 23 mm cannons. They were fast enough to dive past the fighter escort of P-80 Shooting Stars and F9F Panthers and could reach and destroy the U.S. heavy bombers. B-29 losses could not be avoided, and the Air Force was forced to switch from a daylight bombing campaign to the necessarily less accurate nighttime bombing of targets. The MiGs were countered by the F-86 Sabres. They had a ceiling of 42,000 feet (13,000 m) and were armed with six .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns, which were range adjusted by radar gunsights. If coming in at higher altitude the advantage of engaging or not went to the MiG. Once in a level flight dogfight, both swept-wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around 660 mph (1,100 km/h). The MiG climbed faster, but the Sabre turned and dived better.

Question: What impact did Madonna's involvement in mainstream films have on her music career in the 1980s?   Answer: Madonna's involvement in mainstream films had a significant impact on her music career in the 1980s. Her appearance in Vision Quest and Desperately Seeking Susan helped to increase her profile and popularity, leading to her U.S. number-one single "Crazy for You" and her first number one single in the United Kingdom, "Into the Groove". Her profile was such that the movie was widely considered and marketed as a Madonna vehicle, further increasing her fame and success.   Context: Madonna entered mainstream films in February 1985, beginning with a brief appearance as a club singer in Vision Quest, a romantic drama film. Its soundtrack contained two new singles, her U.S. number-one single, "Crazy for You" and "Gambler". She also appeared in the comedy Desperately Seeking Susan in March 1985, a film which introduced the song "Into the Groove", her first number one single in the United Kingdom.

Question: What factors contribute to the high population density in Paris and its surrounding areas compared to other cities in the European Union?   Answer: The high population density in Paris and its surrounding areas compared to other cities in the European Union is likely due to a combination of factors, including the city's central location, its strong economy, its attractive cultural and recreational offerings, and its efficient public transportation system. Additionally, the city's relatively small size and its proximity to other major cities in the region may also contribute to its high population density.   Context: According to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre.

Question: What were the reasons behind Eisenhower's decision to form the SEATO alliance and how did it ultimately involve the United States in the conflict in Vietnam?   Answer: Eisenhower formed the SEATO alliance in response to the French defeat in Vietnam in order to defend against the spread of communism. The alliance included the U.K., France, New Zealand and Australia. Eisenhower agreed to participate in the Geneva peace talks only as an observer, and when France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam, he rejected the agreement and offered military and economic aid to southern Vietnam. This ultimately involved the United States in the conflict in Vietnam, as the formation of SEATO meant that the U.S. was now part of the alliance and was committed to defending against the spread of communism.   Context: Eisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of the SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) Alliance with the U.K., France, New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism. At that time the French and Chinese reconvened Geneva peace talks; Eisenhower agreed the U.S. would participate only as an observer. After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam, Eisenhower rejected the agreement, offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam. Ambrose argues that Eisenhower, by not participating in the Geneva agreement, had kept the U.S out of Vietnam; nevertheless, with the formation of SEATO, he had in the end put the U.S. back into the conflict.

The statistics also reveal that there is an equal number of female and male dog pets, and that less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from a shelter. These statistics indicate that pet adoption is not as popular as pet ownership, and that many people prefer to own one or two dogs.   Context: According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, it is estimated there are 77.5 million people with pet dogs in the United States. The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs.

Question: What is the significance of the establishment of the new Supreme Court of New Zealand in 2004 and its jurisdiction?   Answer: The establishment of the new Supreme Court of New Zealand in 2004 was significant because it marked the beginning of a new era in the country's judicial system. The Supreme Court has a purely appellate jurisdiction, meaning that it hears appeals from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand and, in some cases, appeals may be removed directly to the Supreme Court from the High Court. This gives the Supreme Court the final say in certain cases, making it the highest court in the country and the court of final jurisdiction.   Context: The new Supreme Court of New Zealand was officially established at the beginning of 2004, although it did not come into operation until July. The High Court of New Zealand was until 1980 known as the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has a purely appellate jurisdiction and hears appeals from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand. In some cases, an appeal may be removed directly to the Supreme Court from the High Court.

Question: What were the circumstances surrounding Edmund Burke's resignation from his seat in the Commons and the loss of his son Richard, and how did these events shape his later decisions and attitudes?   Answer: Edmund Burke resigned from his seat in the Commons on 20 June 1794 after receiving a vote of thanks for his services in the Hastings Trial. Shortly after, he suffered a tragic blow with the loss of his son Richard in August 1794. Burke had been tenderly attached to Richard and had seen signs of promise in him, though these were not apparent to others. The death of his son deprived Burke of the opportunity to be created Earl of Beaconsfield, and the only award he would accept was a pension of £2,500. This modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, prompting Burke to write his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796). In this letter, Burke argued that he was rewarded on merit, while the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone. Burke also hinted at what would happen to people with revolutionary ideas if they were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution. These events shaped Burke's later decisions and attitudes, as he became more critical of the French Revolution and more determined to defend the British constitution.   Context: On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of £2,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): "It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: "Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth".

Question: How did the Hellenistic period influence the cultural interactions between Greek colonies and local tribal peoples in the Bosporan Kingdom?   Answer: The Hellenistic period had a significant influence on the cultural interactions between Greek colonies and local tribal peoples in the Bosporan Kingdom. The Spartocids, a hellenized Thracian family from Panticapaeum, were the ruling dynasty of the Bosporan Kingdom and had long-lasting trade contacts with the Scythian peoples of the Pontic-Caspian steppe. This resulted in the spread of Hellenistic culture and language to the Scythian settlements of the Crimea, such as in the Scythian Neapolis. The Scythians also adopted some Greek products and art styles, and some Scythians even became Hellenized. The peoples around Pontic Olbia, known as the Callipidae, were intermixed and Hellenized Greco-Scythians. Thus, the Hellenistic period had a significant influence on the cultural interactions between Greek colonies and local tribal peoples in the Bosporan Kingdom.   Context: Before the Hellenistic period, Greek colonies had been established on the coast of the Crimean and Taman peninsulas. The Bosporan Kingdom was a multi-ethnic kingdom of Greek city states and local tribal peoples such as the Maeotians, Thracians, Crimean Scythians and Cimmerians under the Spartocid dynasty (438–110 BCE). The Spartocids were a hellenized Thracian family from Panticapaeum. The Bosporans had long lasting trade contacts with the Scythian peoples of the Pontic-Caspian steppe, and Hellenistic influence can be seen in the Scythian settlements of the Crimea, such as in the Scythian Neapolis. Scythian pressure on the Bosporan kingdom under Paerisades V led to its eventual vassalage under the Pontic king Mithradates VI for protection, circa 107 BCE. It later became a Roman client state. Other Scythians on the steppes of Central Asia came into contact with Hellenistic culture through the Greeks of Bactria. Many Scythian elites purchased Greek products and some Scythian art shows Greek influences. At least some Scythians seem to have become Hellenized, because we know of conflicts between the elites of the Scythian kingdom over the adoption of Greek ways. These Hellenized Scythians were known as the "young Scythians". The peoples around Pontic Olbia, known as the Callipidae, were intermixed and Hellenized Greco-Scythians.   Score: 0.905496597 
Question: What are the different tissues that make up human teeth and how do they contribute to the ability of sensation during chewing?   Answer: Human teeth are made up of three different tissues: enamel, dentine, and cementum. Enamel is the hardest and most highly mineralized tissue in the body, and it covers the crown of the tooth. Dentine is a softer, more porous tissue that lies beneath the enamel and makes up the bulk of the tooth. Cementum is a thin layer of tissue that covers the root of the tooth and helps to anchor it in the jawbone. These tissues contribute to the ability of sensation during chewing by providing a blood and nerve supply to the teeth, which allows them to send messages to the brain when something is too hard to chew.   Context: Teeth (singular tooth) are small whitish structures found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates that are used to tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.

Question: How has the genre of Urban AC music contributed to the representation and recognition of African-American artists in the wider national audience?   Answer: Urban AC music has contributed to the representation and recognition of African-American artists in the wider national audience by providing a platform for them to showcase their music and reach a larger audience. Des'ree's album I Ain't Movin' is a prime example of this, as it was massively popular amongst both African American audiences and the wider national audience. This has allowed African-American artists to gain more recognition and appreciation from a wider audience, which has helped to increase their representation in the music industry.   Context: Urban AC is a form of AC music geared towards adult African-American audiences, and therefore, the artists that are played on these stations are most often black, such as Des'ree, whose album I Ain't Movin' was massively popular amongst both African American audience as well as the wider national audience.

Question: What is the significance of DNA replication in the growth, development, and reproduction of organisms?   Answer: DNA replication is essential for the growth, development, and reproduction of organisms because it allows for the duplication of genes in the genome. This duplication is necessary for the production of two identical daughter cells, which are essential for the continuation of the species. Without DNA replication, the genetic information of the organism would not be passed on to the next generation.   Context: The growth, development, and reproduction of organisms relies on cell division, or the process by which a single cell divides into two usually identical daughter cells. This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called DNA replication.:5.2 The copies are made by specialized enzymes known as DNA polymerases, which "read" one strand of the double-helical DNA, known as the template strand, and synthesize a new complementary strand. Because the DNA double helix is held together by base pairing, the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement; hence only one strand needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy. The process of DNA replication is semiconservative; that is, the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand of DNA.:5.2   Score: 0.878387868

Answer: Some significant highways and routes that pass through Santa Monica, California include the Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10), State Route 2 (Santa Monica Boulevard), U.S. Route 66, and Interstate 405 (the "San Diego Freeway").   Context: The Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10) begins in Santa Monica near the Pacific Ocean and heads east. The Santa Monica Freeway between Santa Monica and downtown Los Angeles has the distinction of being one of the busiest highways in all of North America. After traversing Los Angeles County, I-10 crosses seven more states, terminating at Jacksonville, Florida.

State Route 2 (Santa Monica Boulevard) begins in Santa Monica, barely grazing State Route 1 at Lincoln Boulevard, and continues northeast across Los Angeles County, through the Angeles National Forest, crossing the San Gabriel Mountains as the Angeles Crest Highway, ending in Wrightwood. Santa Monica is also the western (Pacific) terminus of historic U.S. Route 66. Close to the eastern boundary of Santa Monica, Sepulveda Boulevard reaches from Long Beach at the south, to the northern end of the San Fernando Valley.

Question: What were some of the significant historical events and influences that shaped Tajikistan's early history?   Answer: Some of the significant historical events and influences that shaped Tajikistan's early history include the Achaemenid Empire's conquest of the region, Alexander the Great's conquest of the region, the invasion of Sogdia by Scythians and Yuezhi nomadic tribes, and the expedition of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Wudi. These events and influences led to the establishment of commercial relations between Han China and Sogdiana, and the development of Sogdian culture in the region.   Context: The earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500 BCE when much, if not all, of modern Tajikistan was part of the Achaemenid Empire. Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BCE parts of modern Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of Kambojas before it became part of the Achaemenid Empire. After the region's conquest by Alexander the Great it became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern Tajikistan (the cities of Khujand and Panjakent) was part of Sogdia, a collection of city-states which was overrun by Scythians and Yuezhi nomadic tribes around 150 BCE. The Silk Road passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Wudi (141–87 BCE) commercial relations between Han China and Sogdiana flourished.

Question: What are some factors that contributed to the regional differences in the development and expression of Gothic architecture across Europe?   Answer: Some factors that contributed to the regional differences in the development and expression of Gothic architecture across Europe include the availability of local materials, the influence of local cultures and traditions, the availability of skilled craftsmen, and the transfer of bishops from one region to another. Additionally, the political and economic conditions of the time, as well as the religious beliefs of the people, may have had an impact on the development and expression of Gothic architecture in different regions.   Context: From the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic.   Score: 0.894315422

The need for private guard units to protect civil and religious institutions. 4. The ideals of the bushi (warrior) or samurai (literally, one who serves).   Context: Under the early courts, when military conscription had been centrally controlled, military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy. But as the system broke down after 792, local power holders again became the primary source of military strength. The re-establishment of an efficient military system was made gradually through a process of trial-and-error. At that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of oryoshi, which were appointed to an individual province and tsuibushi, which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks.

Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence with his own actions, such as sending his children to a foundling hospital, which Burke saw as an example of Rousseau being a "lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred".   Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more "very refreshing mental food" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed "a considerable insight into human nature" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau "entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity"—which he "was possessed to a degree little short of madness". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of "obscure and vulgar vices" that was not "chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: "a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred".   Score: 0.88863951 
Question: What were the efforts made by the "Cotton-4" group of African countries to reduce US cotton subsidies through negotiations?   Answer: The "Cotton-4" group of African countries introduced a "Sectoral Initiative in Favour of Cotton" to reduce US cotton subsidies through negotiations. This initiative was presented by Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaoré during the Trade Negotiations Committee on 10 June 2003.   Context: While Brazil was fighting the US through the WTO's Dispute Settlement Mechanism against a heavily subsidized cotton industry, a group of four least-developed African countries – Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali – also known as "Cotton-4" have been the leading protagonist for the reduction of US cotton subsidies through negotiations.

Question: What were some key factors that contributed to John Kerry's dominance in the United States presidential election of 2004, despite facing competition from candidates like John Edwards?   Answer: 1. The support of fellow Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, who assigned Mary Beth Cahill to be the campaign manager. 2. John Kerry's mortgaging of his own home to lend money to his campaign. 3. The addition of Michael Whouley to the campaign, who was credited with helping bring home the Iowa victory. 4. A string of wins in Michigan, Washington, Maine, Tennessee, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Wisconsin, Utah, Hawaii, and Idaho. 5. The withdrawal of other candidates like Howard Dean and Joe Lieberman.   Context: In sheer numbers, Kerry had fewer endorsements than Howard Dean, who was far ahead in the superdelegate race going into the Iowa caucuses in January 2004, although Kerry led the endorsement race in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico and Nevada. Kerry's main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for the Kerry campaign before Iowa. Heading into the primaries, Kerry's campaign was largely seen as in trouble, particularly after he fired campaign manager Jim Jordan. The key factors enabling it to survive were when fellow Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy assigned Mary Beth Cahill to be the campaign manager, as well as Kerry's mortgaging his own home to lend the money to his campaign (while his wife was a billionaire, campaign finance rules prohibited using one's personal fortune). He also brought on the "magical" Michael Whouley who would be credited with helping bring home the Iowa victory the same as he did in New Hampshire for Al Gore in 2000 against Bill Bradley.

Question: What were the significant achievements of the Kushan Empire in northern India during the 1st century CE?   Answer: The significant achievements of the Kushan Empire in northern India during the 1st century CE included the expansion of their territory from what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the subcontinent, the conquest of most of northern India, and the spread of their Indo-European language. They also established trade routes and diplomatic relations with other empires in the region, and their rule brought a period of peace and stability to the region.   Context: The Kushan Empire expanded out of what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the subcontinent under the leadership of their first emperor, Kujula Kadphises, about the middle of the 1st century CE. They came of an Indo-European language speaking Central Asian tribe called the Yuezhi, a branch of which was known as the Kushans. By the time of his grandson, Kanishka, they had conquered most of northern India, at least as far as Saketa and Pataliputra, in the middle Ganges Valley, and probably as far as the Bay of Bengal.

Question: What are some methods for controlling the speed of a motor and how do they impact power dissipation in the external resistance?   Answer: One method for controlling the speed of a motor is to use a variable resistor in the rotor circuit. This allows the motor to operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque. However, this method results in significant power being dissipated in the external resistance. Another method for controlling the speed of a motor is to use a wound rotor induction motor (WRIM). In this type of motor, the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to slip rings on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. This allows for control of the motor speed, but again, significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A third method for controlling the speed of a motor is to use a converter fed from the rotor circuit. This allows the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted to be returned into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator. This method results in less power being dissipated in the external resistance than the other two methods.   Context: When used with a load that has a torque curve that increases with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque. Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor.   Score: 0.841364145 
Question: What were the consequences and impact of the violent incident on Black Saturday in Samoa?   Answer: The consequences and impact of the violent incident on Black Saturday in Samoa were devastating. Ten people were killed and approximately 50 were injured by gunshot wounds and police batons. The incident caused a great deal of trauma and fear among the Samoan people, and it further galvanized the Mau resistance movement against New Zealand's colonial rule. The incident also led to the exile of one of the Mau leaders, Olaf Frederick Nelson, and it increased the influence of the Mau's women's branch. The incident is remembered in Samoa as Black Saturday and is a reminder of the struggle for independence and freedom.   Context: The New Zealand police attempted to arrest one of the leaders in the demonstration. When he resisted, a struggle developed between the police and the Mau. The officers began to fire randomly into the crowd and a Lewis machine gun, mounted in preparation for this demonstration, was used to disperse the demonstrators. Chief Tamasese was shot from behind and killed while trying to bring calm and order to the Mau demonstrators, screaming "Peace, Samoa". Ten others died that day and approximately 50 were injured by gunshot wounds and police batons. That day would come to be known in Samoa as Black Saturday. The Mau grew, remaining steadfastly non-violent, and expanded to include a highly influential women's branch.   Score: 0.878787816 
Question: What were the reasons behind England's strained relationship with FIFA and their departure from the organization in 1928?   Answer: The reasons behind England's strained relationship with FIFA and their departure from the organization in 1928 were largely due to the fact that the English Football Association (FA) was not in favor of FIFA's rules and regulations. The FA was also unhappy with FIFA's decision to allow foreign teams to compete in the World Cup, which they felt was unfair to the Home Nations. Additionally, the FA was not in favor of FIFA's decision to allow professional players to compete in the World Cup, which they felt would give an unfair advantage to teams with more money.   Context: To begin with, England had no permanent home stadium. They joined FIFA in 1906 and played their first ever games against countries other than the Home Nations on a tour of Central Europe in 1908. Wembley Stadium was opened in 1923 and became their home ground. The relationship between England and FIFA became strained, and this resulted in their departure from FIFA in 1928, before they rejoined in 1946. As a result, they did not compete in a World Cup until 1950, in which they were beaten in a 1–0 defeat by the United States, failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team's history.

Question: How has the incorporation of folk music in classical compositions influenced the nationalist themes portrayed by composers like Dvořák, Smetana, and Bartók?   Answer: The incorporation of folk music in classical compositions has allowed composers like Dvořák, Smetana, and Bartók to create works that are imbued with a strong sense of nationalism. By incorporating folk music into their compositions, these composers have been able to create works that evoke a sense of national pride and identity. This has allowed them to create works that are both musically and emotionally powerful, and that can be used to express a sense of national identity.   Context: Composers of classical music have often made use of folk music (music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained, often from a purely oral tradition). Some composers, like Dvořák and Smetana, have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others like Bartók have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins.

Question: What are the advantages of the CD+G format in terms of storing and displaying graphics information?   Answer: The CD+G format has several advantages when it comes to storing and displaying graphics information. It takes advantage of the channels R through W, which are used to store the graphics information. This allows for a higher resolution of graphics than other formats, as well as a larger storage capacity. Additionally, the graphics can be displayed on a regular audio CD player, or on a special CD+G player that is hooked up to a television set or computer monitor.

Answer: The presence of foreign troops in Iran during World War II allowed the Soviet Union to gain a foothold in the nation, which they used to establish two puppet regimes in the nation; the Azerbaijan People's Government, and the Republic of Mahabad. The refusal of the Soviet Union to relinquish the occupied Iranian territory led to the Iran crisis of 1946, which resulted in the dissolution of both puppet states and the withdrawal of the Soviets.   Context: In 1941, Reza Shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and established the Persian Corridor, a massive supply route that would last until the end of the ongoing war. The presence of so many foreign troops in the nation also culminated in the Soviet-backed establishment of two puppet regimes in the nation; the Azerbaijan People's Government, and the Republic of Mahabad.

Question: How did the major reforms initiated by Wang Mang during the Han dynasty contribute to his regime's downfall?   Answer: The major reforms initiated by Wang Mang during the Han dynasty contributed to his regime's downfall by provoking considerable opposition and by weakening the value of coinage. The weakened currency, combined with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD, caused economic instability and further weakened Wang Mang's regime. This ultimately led to its downfall.   Context: Wang Mang initiated a series of major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful. These reforms included outlawing slavery, nationalizing land to equally distribute between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage. Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works.

Question: What were the contributing factors to the decrease in deaths from infectious diseases prior to World War II, and how did the development of anti-infective drugs and vaccines play a role in this?   Answer: Prior to World War II, the decrease in deaths from infectious diseases was largely attributed to improved sanitation, better nutrition, and improved living conditions. The development of anti-infective drugs and vaccines played a major role in further reducing the death rate from infectious diseases. Vaccines, such as the polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, provided protection against many of the most deadly infectious diseases. Anti-infective drugs, such as antibiotics, were also developed during this period and were effective in treating many of the most common infectious diseases. The combination of improved sanitation, better nutrition, improved living conditions, and the development of anti-infective drugs and vaccines resulted in a dramatic decrease in the death rate from infectious diseases.   Context: During the years 1940-1955, the rate of decline in the U.S. death rate accelerated from 2% per year to 8% per year, then returned to the historical rate of 2% per year. The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years. Vaccine development continued to accelerate, with the most notable achievement of the period being Jonas Salk's 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of Merck Sharp & Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species. It was later determined that SV40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90% of the children in the United States. The contamination appears to have originated both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production.

Question: How does the resonance principle influence the design of antennas and their ability to reflect moving electrons?   Answer: The resonance principle influences the design of antennas by allowing them to reflect moving electrons off surfaces where the dielectric constant changes. This is similar to the way light reflects when optical properties change. The reflective surface is created by the end of a conductor, normally a thin metal wire or rod, which has a feed point at one end where it is connected to a transmission line. The conductor, or element, is aligned with the electrical field of the desired signal, normally meaning it is perpendicular to the line from the antenna to the source (or receiver in the case of a broadcast antenna). This allows the antenna to effectively capture and reflect the desired signal.   Context: The majority of antenna designs are based on the resonance principle. This relies on the behaviour of moving electrons, which reflect off surfaces where the dielectric constant changes, in a fashion similar to the way light reflects when optical properties change. In these designs, the reflective surface is created by the end of a conductor, normally a thin metal wire or rod, which in the simplest case has a feed point at one end where it is connected to a transmission line.

Answer: The media's replaying of the "Dean Scream" had a significant negative impact on Howard Dean's presidential campaign in 2004. The incessant replaying of the scene by the press created a debate on the topic of whether Dean was the victim of media bias, which damaged his reputation and credibility. This, combined with the dismal results of the Iowa caucus, caused Gephardt and Carol Moseley Braun to drop out and endorse other candidates, further damaging Dean's chances of winning the election.   Context: The dismal results caused Gephardt to drop out and later endorse Kerry. Carol Moseley Braun also dropped out, endorsing Howard Dean. Besides the impact of coming in third, Dean was further hurt by a speech he gave at a post-caucus rally. Dean was shouting over the cheers of his enthusiastic audience, but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion. The incessant replaying of the "Dean Scream" by the press became a debate on the topic of whether Dean was the victim of media bias. The scream scene was shown approximately 633 times by cable and broadcast news networks in just four days following the incident, a number that does not include talk shows and local news broadcasts.

Question: What were some challenges faced by Josip Broz Tito and Jovanka Broz in their relationship, and how did these challenges impact their roles in Yugoslavia's history?   Answer: Josip Broz Tito and Jovanka Broz faced many challenges in their relationship, including episodes of infidelity and allegations of a coup d'état. These challenges had a significant impact on their roles in Yugoslavia's history, as Jovanka was the only female companion Tito married while in power and was thus remembered as Yugoslavia's first lady. The couple's tumultuous relationship was often played out in public, which caused a great deal of embarrassment and controversy. The allegations of a coup d'état, in particular, caused a great deal of distrust and suspicion between Tito and Jovanka, and ultimately led to their formal divorce in the late 1970s, shortly before Tito's death. Despite this, Jovanka was still present at Tito's funeral as his wife and later claimed rights for inheritance.   Context: His best known wife was Jovanka Broz. Tito was just shy of his 59th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief Aleksandar Ranković as the best man. Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally. At that time, she was in her early 20s and Tito, objecting to her energetic personality, opted for the more mature opera singer Zinka Kunc instead. Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at Beli Dvor, where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance after Tito's strange relationship with Zinka failed. Since Jovanka was the only female companion he married while in power, she also went down in history as Yugoslavia's first lady. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a coup d'état by the latter pair. Certain unofficial reports suggest Tito and Jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s, shortly before his death. However, during Tito's funeral she was officially present as his wife, and later claimed rights for inheritance. The couple did not have any children.   Score: 0.871525288 
Question: What were the reasons behind the Tucson Padres' temporary relocation from Portland to Tucson and then to El Paso?   Answer: The Tucson Padres were temporarily relocated from Portland to Tucson while awaiting the building of a new stadium in Escondido. Legal issues derailed the plans to build the Escondido stadium, so they moved to El Paso, Texas for the 2014 season.   Context: The Tucson Padres played at Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium from 2011 to 2013. They served as the AAA affiliate of the San Diego Padres. The team, formerly known as the Portland Beavers, was temporarily relocated to Tucson from Portland while awaiting the building of a new stadium in Escondido. Legal issues derailed the plans to build the Escondido stadium, so they moved to El Paso, Texas for the 2014 season. Previously, the Tucson Sidewinders, a triple-A affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks, won the Pacific Coast League championship and unofficial AAA championship in 2006. The Sidewinders played in Tucson Electric Park and were in the Pacific Conference South of the PCL. The Sidewinders were sold in 2007 and moved to Reno, Nevada after the 2008 season.

Question: What factors contributed to the hiatus on executions in Tennessee from 1913 to 1915 and the subsequent change in the method of execution in 1916?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the hiatus on executions in Tennessee from 1913 to 1915 and the subsequent change in the method of execution in 1916 are unclear. It is possible that the state legislature passed a law that temporarily suspended executions, or that the Supreme Court ruling in Furman v. Georgia had an effect on the state's ability to carry out executions. Additionally, the change in the method of execution from hanging to electrocution may have been due to the development of new technology or a shift in public opinion.   Context: Capital punishment has existed in Tennessee at various times since statehood. Before 1913 the method of execution was hanging. From 1913 to 1915 there was a hiatus on executions but they were reinstated in 1916 when electrocution became the new method. From 1972 to 1978, after the Supreme Court ruled (Furman v. Georgia) capital punishment unconstitutional, there were no further executions. Capital punishment was restarted in 1978, although those prisoners awaiting execution between 1960 and 1978 had their sentences mostly commuted to life in prison. From 1916 to 1960 the state executed 125 inmates. For a variety of reasons there were no further executions until 2000. Since 2000, Tennessee has executed six prisoners and has 73 prisoners on death row (as of April 2015).   Score: 0.881433547 
Question: What is the significance of the Latin word "insectum" and its relation to the term "insect"?   Answer: The Latin word "insectum" is significant because it is the origin of the term "insect". It is derived from the neuter singular perfect passive participle of insectare, "to cut into, to cut up", from in- "into" and secare "to cut"; because insects appear "cut into" three sections. This is why the term "insect" was chosen to describe this class of life, as it accurately reflects the physical characteristics of the creatures.   Context: The word "insect" comes from the Latin word insectum, meaning "with a notched or divided body", or literally "cut into", from the neuter singular perfect passive participle of insectare, "to cut into, to cut up", from in- "into" and secare "to cut"; because insects appear "cut into" three sections. Pliny the Elder introduced the Latin designation as a loan-translation of the Greek word ἔντομος (éntomos) or "insect" (as in entomology), which was Aristotle's term for this class of life, also in reference to their "notched" bodies. "Insect" first appears documented in English in 1601 in Holland's translation of Pliny. Translations of Aristotle's term also form the usual word for "insect" in Welsh (trychfil, from trychu "to cut" and mil, "animal"), Serbo-Croatian (zareznik, from rezati, "to cut"), Russian (насекомое nasekomoje, from seč'/-sekat', "to cut"), etc.   Score: 0.892129 
Question: How did the response from the general public towards the addition of the category of "bi-racial" or "multiracial" in 1988 impact the efforts of parents of mixed-race children and adults of mixed-race ancestry to show more than one ethnic category on Census and other legal forms?   Answer: The response from the general public towards the addition of the category of "bi-racial" or "multiracial" in 1988 had a negative impact on the efforts of parents of mixed-race children and adults of mixed-race ancestry to show more than one ethnic category on Census and other legal forms. The negative response from the general public made it more difficult for these groups to gain recognition and acceptance of their multiple ethnic identities.   Context: By the 1980s, parents of mixed-race children (and adults of mixed-race ancestry) began to organize and lobby for the ability to show more than one ethnic category on Census and other legal forms. They refused to be put into just one category. When the U.S. government proposed the addition of the category of "bi-racial" or "multiracial" in 1988, the response from the general public was mostly negative. Some African-American organizations and political leaders, such as Senator Diane Watson and Representative Augustus Hawkins, were particularly vocal in their rejection of the category. They feared a loss in political and economic power if African Americans abandoned their one category.   Score: 0.935720086 
Question: What were some of the challenges Thomas Edison faced in developing a practical incandescent lamp and how did he overcome them?   Answer: Thomas Edison faced many challenges in developing a practical incandescent lamp. Initially, he experimented with carbon filaments, but these were not successful. He then experimented with platinum and other metals, but eventually returned to a carbon filament. He also had to find a way to create the carbon filament, and experimented with various materials such as cotton and linen thread, wood splints, and papers coiled in various ways. Eventually, Edison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last more than 1200 hours. Finally, Edison had to find a way to power the lamp, and the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company steamer, Columbia, became the first application for Edison's incandescent electric lamps.   Context: Thomas Edison began serious research into developing a practical incandescent lamp in 1878. Edison filed his first patent application for "Improvement In Electric Lights" on 14 October 1878. After many experiments, first with carbon in the early 1880s and then with platinum and other metals, in the end Edison returned to a carbon filament. The first successful test was on 22 October 1879, and lasted 13.5 hours. Edison continued to improve this design and by 4 November 1879, filed for a US patent for an electric lamp using "a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected ... to platina contact wires." Although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including using "cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways," Edison and his team later discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last more than 1200 hours. In 1880, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company steamer, Columbia, became the first application for Edison's incandescent electric lamps (it was also the first ship to execute use of a dynamo).

Question: What are some examples of rock musicians using mandolins in their music and how do they incorporate the instrument into their sound?   Answer: Some examples of rock musicians using mandolins in their music include Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys, Peter Buck of R.E.M., Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes, System of A Down, Green Day, Boyd Tinsley of the Dave Matthews Band, Colin Meloy and Chris Funk of The Decemberists, and Nancy Wilson of Heart. These musicians incorporate the mandolin into their sound by using it to accentuate the growling sound they favor, as well as to provide simple licks and melodies. The mandolin is also used to provide a unique texture to the music, as well as to evoke traditional Celtic music.   Context: Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit "Losing My Religion" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song "Locust Street." Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist of Heart, uses a mandolin in Heart's song "Dream of the Archer" from the album Little Queen, as well as in Heart's cover of Led Zeppelin's song "The Battle of Evermore."

Question: How did Nasser's policies in Egypt during the 1950s and 1960s contribute to social mobility and the growth of the middle class?   Answer: Nasser's policies in Egypt during the 1950s and 1960s contributed to social mobility and the growth of the middle class by introducing land reform and distribution, dramatically increasing university education, and providing government support to national industries. These policies allowed millions of previously poor Egyptians to gain access to education and jobs in the public sector, which enabled them to join the middle class. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, and journalists were among the professions that benefited from these policies, leading to a swelling of the middle class in Egypt under Nasser.   Context: At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s, less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich, four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor. Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school, most of them being boys. Nasser's policies changed this. Land reform and distribution, the dramatic growth in university education, and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve. From academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66, overall public school enrolments more than doubled. Millions of previously poor Egyptians, through education and jobs in the public sector, joined the middle class. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists, constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser. During the 1960s, the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.   Score: 0.911787927 
Question: What were some of the reasons for the expulsion and dispersal of Jewish communities during the Middle Ages, and how did this impact their migration patterns and settlement in different regions?   Answer: The expulsion and dispersal of Jewish communities during the Middle Ages was largely due to religious persecution and anti-Semitism. This led to Jews being expelled from England in 1290, France in 1306, and Spain in 1492. As a result, many Jews were forced to emigrate eastwards, settling in Poland and Hungary. This migration also had an impact on their economic activities, as Jews were restricted from certain financial activities and had to focus on trade, business management, and financial services. This allowed them to rely on family members living in different regions and countries, and also contributed to the rise of banking in Italy during the 13th century.   Context: Jewish communities were expelled from England in 1290 and from France in 1306. Although some were allowed back into France, most were not, and many Jews emigrated eastwards, settling in Poland and Hungary. The Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, and dispersed to Turkey, France, Italy, and Holland. The rise of banking in Italy during the 13th century continued throughout the 14th century, fuelled partly by the increasing warfare of the period and the needs of the papacy to move money between kingdoms.

Question: What were the key factors that contributed to the downfall of the Sikh Empire in the face of the powerful British East India Company?   Answer: The key factors that contributed to the downfall of the Sikh Empire in the face of the powerful British East India Company were Maharaja Ranjit Singh's death, the subsequent battles of succession and infighting between factions at court, the breakdown of relationships with neighbouring British territories, and the two Anglo-Sikh Wars.   Context: Maharaja Ranjit Singh's death in the summer of 1839 brought political chaos and the subsequent battles of succession and the bloody infighting between the factions at court weakened the state. Relationships with neighbouring British territories then broke down, starting the First Anglo-Sikh War; this led to a British official being resident in Lahore and the annexation in 1849 of territory south of the Satluj to British India. After the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849, the Sikh Empire became the last territory to be merged into British India.

Question: What were Mikhail Gorbachev's initial goals as General Secretary and how did he plan to achieve them?   Answer: Mikhail Gorbachev's initial goal as General Secretary was to revive the Soviet economy. To achieve this goal, he implemented reforms that included personnel changes of senior Brezhnev-era officials who would impede political and economic change. He also brought two protégés, Yegor Ligachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov, into the Politburo as full members, and promoted KGB Head Viktor Chebrikov from candidate to full member and appointed Minister of Defence Marshal Sergei Sokolov as a Politburo candidate.   Context: Mikhail Gorbachev was elected General Secretary by the Politburo on March 11, 1985, three hours after predecessor Konstantin Chernenko's death at age 73. Gorbachev, aged 54, was the youngest member of the Politburo. His initial goal as general secretary was to revive the Soviet economy, and he realized that doing so would require reforming underlying political and social structures. The reforms began with personnel changes of senior Brezhnev-era officials who would impede political and economic change. On April 23, 1985, Gorbachev brought two protégés, Yegor Ligachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov, into the Politburo as full members.

Question: What is the significance of the multiplicative group of integers modulo p in the context of prime numbers?   Answer: The multiplicative group of integers modulo p is significant in the context of prime numbers because it provides a way to perform modular arithmetic operations on the set of integers from 1 to p-1. This allows for the calculation of the remainder of a division by p, which is useful for solving equations and performing other mathematical operations.   Context: For any prime number p, there is also the multiplicative group of integers modulo p. Its elements are the integers 1 to p − 1. The group operation is multiplication modulo p. That is, the usual product is divided by p and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication. For example, if p = 5, there are four group elements 1, 2, 3, 4.

Answer: The key factors that led to the Chicago Cubs' disappointing performance in the 2004 season despite being favored to win the World Series were a mid-season deal for Nomar Garciaparra, misfortune striking the team again, and a blown save by reliever LaTroy Hawkins. The Cubs had a 1.5 game lead over San Francisco and Houston on September 25, and both of those teams lost that day, giving the Cubs a chance to increase the lead to a commanding 2.5 games with only eight games remaining in the season. However, Hawkins blew the save to the Mets, and the Cubs lost the game in extra innings, a defeat that seemingly deflated the team, as they proceeded to drop 6 of their last 8 games as the Astros won the Wild Card.   Context: In 2004, the Cubs were a consensus pick by most media outlets to win the World Series. The offseason acquisition of Derek Lee (who was acquired in a trade with Florida for Hee-seop Choi) and the return of Greg Maddux only bolstered these expectation. Despite a mid-season deal for Nomar Garciaparra, misfortune struck the Cubs again.

Question: How does the comparison between Harper Lee and Jane Austen in terms of challenging social norms and valuing individual worth over social standing contribute to the understanding of the characters and themes in "To Kill a Mockingbird"?   Answer: The comparison between Harper Lee and Jane Austen in terms of challenging social norms and valuing individual worth over social standing contributes to the understanding of the characters and themes in "To Kill a Mockingbird" by highlighting the importance of individual worth and the need to challenge the status quo. Through the characters of Atticus, Calpurnia, and Aunt Alexandra, Lee demonstrates the importance of respecting individual worth and standing up for what is right, even if it means challenging the social norms of the time. This is further explored through Scout and Jem's coming of age, as they learn to understand the separations of race and class and the realities of being an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. Ultimately, Lee's comparison to Austen emphasizes the need to challenge the status quo and value individual worth over social standing, which is a key theme in "To Kill a Mockingbird".   Context: In a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was "to be ... the Jane Austen of South Alabama." Both Austen and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day, Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so. Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia. One writer notes that Scout, "in Austenian fashion", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify.

Context: IBM was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935) and paid vacations (1937). In 1932 IBM created an Education Department to oversee training for employees, which oversaw the completion of the IBM Schoolhouse at Endicott in 1933. In 1935, the employee magazine Think was created. Also that year, IBM held its first training class for female systems service professionals. In 1942, IBM launched a program to train and employ disabled people in Topeka, Kansas. The next year classes began in New York City, and soon the company was asked to join the President's Committee for Employment of the Handicapped.

Question: What are the four stages involved in the act of predation and how do predator and prey species engage in an evolutionary arms race to maximize their abilities?   Answer: The four stages involved in the act of predation are detection of prey, attack, capture, and consumption. Predator and prey species engage in an evolutionary arms race to maximize their abilities by developing adaptations that allow them to either more effectively obtain food or avoid being eaten. For example, prey species may develop camouflage or defensive strategies to avoid being detected by predators, while predators may develop better senses or faster speeds to more effectively detect and capture prey.   Context: The act of predation can be broken down into a maximum of four stages: Detection of prey, attack, capture and finally consumption. The relationship between predator and prey is one that is typically beneficial to the predator, and detrimental to the prey species. Sometimes, however, predation has indirect benefits to the prey species, though the individuals preyed upon themselves do not benefit. This means that, at each applicable stage, predator and prey species are in an evolutionary arms race to maximize their respective abilities to obtain food or avoid being eaten.

Willett independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer's day. Pearce introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on 12 February 1908. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.   Context: Modern DST was first proposed by the New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, whose shift-work job gave him leisure time to collect insects, and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch, he followed up in an 1898 paper. Many publications credit DST's proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer's day. An avid golfer, he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two years later. The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Pearce, who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on 12 February 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law, and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.   Score: 0.868701458 
Question: What are some examples of instances where a referee stopped a professional wrestling match due to a wrestler's inability to continue?   Answer: Examples of instances where a referee stopped a professional wrestling match due to a wrestler's inability to continue include: - At the Great American Bash in 2008, Chris Jericho was declared the winner of a match against Shawn Michaels when Michaels could not defend himself due to excessive blood loss and impaired vision. - At NXT TakeOver: Rival in 2015, the referee stopped the match when Sami Zayn could not defend himself due to an injury sustained against Kevin Owens for the NXT Championship.   Context: A referee may stop the match when they or official ring physician decides that a wrestler cannot safely continue the match. This may be decided if the wrestler cannot continue the match due to an injury. At the Great American Bash in 2008, Chris Jericho was declared the winner of a match against Shawn Michaels when Michaels could not defend himself due to excessive blood loss and impaired vision.

Question: What were some factors that contributed to Frédéric Chopin's unique position as a composer, and how did they shape his contemporary and later reputation?   Answer: Frédéric Chopin's unique position as a composer was shaped by a combination of factors. Firstly, he was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831, where he was exposed to an artistic environment, publishers who were willing to print his music, and wealthy and aristocratic patrons who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons. Secondly, his musical genius was a major factor in his success. Thirdly, his illness and love-affairs conformed to some of the stereotypes of romanticism. Finally, the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soirées) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that "his lack of Byronic flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional" among his romantic contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz. These factors contributed to Chopin's contemporary and later reputation as a unique composer.   Context: Jones comments that "Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned." He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831—"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons"—and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation. While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism, the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soirées) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that "his lack of Byronic flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional" among his romantic contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz.

Question: How do video compression algorithms eliminate spatial and temporal redundancy in order to reduce the size of video data?   Answer: Video compression algorithms eliminate spatial and temporal redundancy by encoding similarities between frames, such as by only storing differences between frames, or by using perceptual features of human vision. Compression algorithms can also average a color across similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to those used in JPEG image compression. These methods can reduce the size of video data while preserving all relevant information from the original, uncompressed video.   Context: Video data may be represented as a series of still image frames. The sequence of frames contains spatial and temporal redundancy that video compression algorithms attempt to eliminate or code in a smaller size. Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between frames, or by using perceptual features of human vision. For example, small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness. Compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to those used in JPEG image compression. Some of these methods are inherently lossy while others may preserve all relevant information from the original, uncompressed video.   Score: 0.914505064

Question: What was the significance of the Lemon v. Kurtzman case in shaping the understanding of the separation of church and state in the United States?   Answer: The Lemon v. Kurtzman case was significant in shaping the understanding of the separation of church and state in the United States because it established that the separation of church and state could never be absolute. The court's decision argued that while there must be a separation between government and religious organizations, it is not a "wall" and is instead a blurred, indistinct, and variable barrier depending on the circumstances of a particular relationship. This decision has been used as a precedent in many subsequent cases involving the separation of church and state.   Context: In Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), the court determined that a Pennsylvania state policy of reimbursing the salaries and related costs of teachers of secular subjects in private religious schools violated the Establishment Clause. The court's decision argued that the separation of church and state could never be absolute: "Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense. Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable," the court wrote. "Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation, far from being a "wall," is a blurred, indistinct, and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship."

Question: What are the potential economic incentives for countries with large rail networks to substitute other fuels for oil and consider rail electrification as a means of consumption pattern reform?   Answer: The potential economic incentives for countries with large rail networks to substitute other fuels for oil and consider rail electrification as a means of consumption pattern reform include reducing dependence on oil reserves, which are much lower than those of gas and coal, and avoiding the economic costs associated with declining oil output. Additionally, rail electrification can help reduce emissions and improve air quality, which can have a positive economic impact.   Context: Energy sources unsuitable for mobile power plants, such as nuclear power, renewable hydroelectricity, or wind power can be used. According to widely accepted global energy reserve statistics, the reserves of liquid fuel are much less than gas and coal (at 42, 167 and 416 years respectively). Most countries with large rail networks do not have significant oil reserves and those that did, like the United States and Britain, have exhausted much of their reserves and have suffered declining oil output for decades. Therefore, there is also a strong economic incentive to substitute other fuels for oil. Rail electrification is often considered an important route towards consumption pattern reform.

Question: How does the concept of consent play a role in the interpretation of a treaty and what legal implications does it have when all parties agree to a particular interpretation?   Answer: Consent plays a major role in the interpretation of a treaty. When all parties to a treaty agree to a particular interpretation, it has the legal effect of adding another clause to the treaty, commonly referred to as an 'authentic interpretation'. This means that the interpretation is binding on all parties and cannot be changed without the consent of all parties. However, a state's consent may be invalidated if there was an erroneous understanding of a fact or situation at the time of conclusion, which formed the "essential basis" of the state's consent.   Context: No one party to a treaty can impose its particular interpretation of the treaty upon the other parties. Consent may be implied, however, if the other parties fail to explicitly disavow that initially unilateral interpretation, particularly if that state has acted upon its view of the treaty without complaint. Consent by all parties to the treaty to a particular interpretation has the legal effect of adding another clause to the treaty – this is commonly called an 'authentic interpretation'.

Question: What factors contributed to the significant rise in the Tibetan Buddhist population and the establishment of numerous monasteries in Kathmandu since the 1960s?   Answer: The significant rise in the Tibetan Buddhist population and the establishment of numerous monasteries in Kathmandu since the 1960s can be attributed to the modernization of Newar Buddhism, the genocide of Shakyas in Lumbini by Virudhaka, and the migration of survivors from Lumbini to Sankhu, Yambu, and Yengal. The migration of the survivors from Lumbini to these areas created the basis of Newar Buddhism, which has allowed it to survive and thrive in the Kathmandu area. Additionally, the modernization of Newar Buddhism has allowed for the establishment of various Theravada Bihars, which has further contributed to the growth of Tibetan Buddhism in the area.

Question: What factors contribute to Tucson's ability to maintain a desert climate despite receiving more precipitation than other locations with similar climates?   Answer: The factors that contribute to Tucson's ability to maintain a desert climate despite receiving more precipitation than other locations with similar climates are its high evapotranspiration and net loss of water. This means that the amount of water that evaporates from the soil and is transpired by plants is greater than the amount of precipitation that falls in the area.   Context: Tucson has a desert climate (Köppen BWh), with two major seasons, summer and winter; plus three minor seasons: fall, spring, and the monsoon. Tucson averages 11.8 inches (299.7 mm) of precipitation per year, more than most other locations with desert climates, but it still qualifies due to its high evapotranspiration; in other words, it experiences a high net loss of water.

Question: What were the different types of scripts in use during the Han period and how did they evolve over time?   Answer: During the Han period, there were two main types of scripts in use: mature clerical script (also known as 八分 (bāfēn) script) and an early type of cursive script. The early type of cursive script incorporated popular cursive forms of the time, as well as elements from the vulgar writing of the Warring State of Qin. By the time of the Eastern Jin dynasty, this Han cursive became known as 章草 zhāngcǎo (also known as 隶草 / 隸草 lìcǎo today), or in English sometimes clerical cursive, ancient cursive, or draft cursive. This script was considered more orderly than the modern form of cursive, which emerged during the Eastern Jin dynasty and is still in use today, called 今草 jīncǎo or "modern cursive".   Context: Contrary to the popular belief of there being only one script per period, there were in fact multiple scripts in use during the Han period. Although mature clerical script, also called 八分 (bāfēn) script, was dominant at that time, an early type of cursive script was also in use by the Han by at least as early as 24 BC (during the very late Western Han period),[b] incorporating cursive forms popular at the time, well as many elements from the vulgar writing of the Warring State of Qin. By around the time of the Eastern Jin dynasty, this Han cursive became known as 章草 zhāngcǎo (also known as 隶草 / 隸草 lìcǎo today), or in English sometimes clerical cursive, ancient cursive, or draft cursive.

Moore's rejection of idealism and his argument against the Berkeleian aphorism "to be is to be perceived" was significant in that it was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors. Moore's argument demonstrated that there is a difference between "yellow" and "the sensation of yellow" and that the object and the subject are not necessarily connected. This was a major step forward in the critique of idealism and helped to establish the foundations of analytic philosophy.   Context: Bradley was the apparent target of G. E. Moore's radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not understand the statement that something is real. We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to Moore. The 1903 article The Refutation of Idealism is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism esse est percipi, "to be is to be perceived", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are necessarily connected so that "yellow" and "the sensation of yellow" are identical - "to be yellow" is "to be experienced as yellow". But it also seems there is a difference between "yellow" and "the sensation of yellow" and "that esse is held to be percipi, solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it". Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by Berkeley.

Question: What factors contributed to the significant growth and proliferation of universities in Europe during the Early Modern period?   Answer: The significant growth and proliferation of universities in Europe during the Early Modern period was largely due to the increased thirst for knowledge, the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions, the emergence of humanism, and the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts. Additionally, rulers and city governments saw the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends.   Context: During the Early Modern period (approximately late 15th century to 1800), the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth, productivity and innovative research. At the end of the Middle Ages, about 400 years after the first university was founded, there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe. In the 15th century, twenty-eight new ones were created, with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625. This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe and Eastern Europe, with the highest concentrations in the German Empire (34), Italian countries (26), France (25), and Spain (23) – this was close to a 500% increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages. This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared, or institutions that merged with other universities during this time. It should be noted that the identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period, as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions.

Question: What are the main arguments for and against affirmative action policies in the United States, and how have court decisions shaped the implementation of these policies?   Answer: The main arguments for affirmative action policies in the United States are that they are necessary to correct decades of discrimination stemming from the Reconstruction Era and to provide disadvantaged minorities with opportunities. Supporters of affirmative action also argue that it increases diversity and helps to create a more equitable society. The main arguments against affirmative action policies are that they lead to reverse discrimination, which entails favoring one group over another based upon racial preference rather than achievement. Opponents also claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects, such as hindering reconciliation, replacing old wrongs with new wrongs, and encouraging groups to identify themselves as disadvantaged. Furthermore, opponents of affirmative action argue that these policies devalue the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, making affirmative action counter-productive. Court decisions have shaped the implementation of affirmative action policies in the United States. The Supreme Court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003 upheld affirmative action as a practice, while the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger ruled that certain policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, were unconstitutional. In 2006, nearly 60% of Michigan voters decided to ban affirmative action in university admissions, joining California, Florida, Texas, and Washington in banning the use of race or sex in admissions considerations.   Context: Affirmative action is a subject of controversy. Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticized as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger. Affirmative action as a practice was upheld by the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003. Affirmative action policies were developed in order to correct decades of discrimination stemming from the Reconstruction Era by granting disadvantaged minorities opportunities. Many believe that the diversity of current American society suggests that affirmative action policies succeeded and are no longer required. Opponents of affirmative action argue that these policies are outdated and lead to reverse discrimination which entails favoring one group over another based upon racial preference rather than achievement.

Question: What are Friedrich Hayek's contributions to social and political philosophy based on his views on the limits of human knowledge and the concept of spontaneous order in social institutions?   Answer: Friedrich Hayek's contributions to social and political philosophy are based on his views on the limits of human knowledge and the concept of spontaneous order in social institutions. He argued in favour of a society organised around a market order, in which the apparatus of state is employed almost exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules, and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. He also argued that his ideal individualistic, free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be 'a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it'.   Context: In the latter half of his career Hayek made a number of contributions to social and political philosophy, which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge, and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions. He argues in favour of a society organised around a market order, in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules, and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge. Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic, free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be 'a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it'.

Question: What were the key factors that led to the Federation of Australia in 1901 and how did it impact the governance structure of the country?   Answer: The key factors that led to the Federation of Australia in 1901 were the desire for a unified nation, the need for a federal government to manage matters concerning the whole nation, and the development of the Constitution of Australia. The Federation of Australia impacted the governance structure of the country by creating a unified nation with a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation, while the individual colonies maintained their own systems of government. This allowed for a balance between the autonomy of the individual colonies and the need for a unified nation.   Context: In 1901, the Federation of Australia was the process by which the six separate British self-governing colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia formed one nation. They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the Constitution of Australia came into force, the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia.   Score: 0.879772 
Question: What were some of the titles and positions granted by the Ming court to the important schools of Tibetan Buddhism during the Ming dynasty?   Answer: Some of the titles and positions granted by the Ming court to the important schools of Tibetan Buddhism during the Ming dynasty were Princes of Dharma (法王), Princes (王), Grand State Tutors (大國師), and State Tutors (國師).

Question: How has the process of gentrification affected the cost of living and overall livability in Boston?   Answer: The process of gentrification has had a significant impact on the cost of living and overall livability in Boston. Housing prices have increased sharply since the 1990s, making living expenses in Boston one of the highest in the United States. Despite this, Boston still ranks high on livability ratings, coming in at 36th worldwide in quality of living in 2011. This suggests that while the cost of living has increased, the overall livability of the city has remained relatively high.   Context: Boston is an intellectual, technological, and political center but has lost some important regional institutions, including the acquisition of The Boston Globe by The New York Times, and the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such as FleetBoston Financial, which was acquired by Charlotte-based Bank of America in 2004. Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene's have both been merged into the Cincinnati–based Macy's. Boston has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen, and Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the United States, and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities.

Question: How does the thermal conductivity of a gas affect the efficiency of an incandescent light bulb?   Answer: The thermal conductivity of a gas affects the efficiency of an incandescent light bulb by conducting heat away from the filament, thereby cooling it and reducing its efficiency. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, so using them in the bulb can help to improve efficiency. However, these gasses are usually more expensive, so their use is limited to smaller lamps.   Context: While inert gas reduces filament evaporation, it also conducts heat from the filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency. At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher. Xenon gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight, but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps.   Score: 0.908332586 
Question: What factors contributed to the Russian army's resilience and ability to withstand the major battle that Napoleon hoped would be decisive?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the Russian army's resilience and ability to withstand the major battle that Napoleon hoped would be decisive include their scorched earth tactics, their willingness to accept and withstand the battle, and their ability to forage food for themselves and their horses. Additionally, Napoleon's hesitation to attack when the opportunity arose may have also contributed to the Russian army's resilience.   Context: The Russians avoided Napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance was made at Smolensk in August; the Russians were defeated in a series of battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.   Score: 0.881560385 
Question: What are some significant contributions of Sumerian writing to the development of human civilization?   Answer: Some significant contributions of Sumerian writing to the development of human civilization include the ability to create historical records, literature in the form of poetic epics and stories, prayers, laws, and lexical lists. Sumerian writing also enabled the creation of libraries full of clay tablets, monumental inscriptions, and texts on different objects like statues or bricks. Additionally, Sumerian writing was used as the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after Semitic speakers had become dominant.   Context: The most important archaeological discoveries in Sumer are a large number of tablets written in cuneiform. Sumerian writing, while proven to be not the oldest example of writing on earth, is considered to be a great milestone in the development of man's ability to not only create historical records but also in creating pieces of literature both in the form of poetic epics and stories as well as prayers and laws. Although pictures — that is, hieroglyphs — were first used, cuneiform and then Ideograms (where symbols were made to represent ideas) soon followed. Triangular or wedge-shaped reeds were used to write on moist clay. A large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the Sumerian language have survived, such as personal or business letters, receipts, lexical lists, laws, hymns, prayers, stories, daily records, and even libraries full of clay tablets. Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects like statues or bricks are also very common.

Question: What is the historical significance of the term "intellectual property" and how has it evolved over time?   Answer: The term "intellectual property" has a long history, with its origins potentially traceable back to Jewish law and the Greek state of Sybaris. Over time, the concept of intellectual creations as property has developed, with the principle of Hasagat Ge'vul being used to justify limited-term publisher copyright in the 16th century. In modern times, intellectual property laws have become more widespread, with copyright, patents, and trademarks being used to protect intellectual creations. Criticism of the term has also grown, with many detractors arguing that it serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform in the public interest or otherwise abusing related legislations.   Context: Criticism of the term intellectual property ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like property and rights in fashions that contradict practice and law.

Question: What evidence supports or refutes the claim that the Ming dynasty upheld a "divide-and-rule" policy towards a weak and politically fragmented Tibet during their reign?   Answer: The evidence that supports the claim that the Ming dynasty upheld a "divide-and-rule" policy towards a weak and politically fragmented Tibet during their reign is Chan's argument that this was perhaps the calculated strategy of the Yongle Emperor, as exclusive patronage to one Tibetan sect would have given it too much regional power. The evidence that refutes the claim that the Ming dynasty upheld a "divide-and-rule" policy towards a weak and politically fragmented Tibet during their reign is Sperling's finding that there is no textual evidence in either Chinese or Tibetan sources to support this thesis of Petech and Hisashi, Norbu's assertion that their thesis is largely based on the list of Ming titles conferred on Tibetan lamas rather than "comparative analysis of developments in China and Tibet," and Rossabi's statement that this theory "attributes too much influence to the Chinese" and discounts the "divide-and-rule" theory on the grounds of the Yongle Emperor's failed attempt to build a strong relationship with the fifth Karmapa.   Context: Historians Luciano Petech and Sato Hisashi argue that the Ming upheld a "divide-and-rule" policy towards a weak and politically fragmented Tibet after the Sakya regime had fallen. Chan writes that this was perhaps the calculated strategy of the Yongle Emperor, as exclusive patronage to one Tibetan sect would have given it too much regional power. Sperling finds no textual evidence in either Chinese or Tibetan sources to support this thesis of Petech and Hisashi. Norbu asserts that their thesis is largely based on the list of Ming titles conferred on Tibetan lamas rather than "comparative analysis of developments in China and Tibet." Rossabi states that this theory "attributes too much influence to the Chinese," pointing out that Tibet was already politically divided when the Ming dynasty began. Rossabi also discounts the "divide-and-rule" theory on the grounds of the Yongle Emperor's failed attempt to build a strong relationship with the fifth Karmapa—one which he hoped would parallel Kublai Khan's earlier relationship with the Sakya Phagpa lama.

Question: What are some thermochemical processes that have been explored for hydrogen production in solar chemical research?   Answer: Some thermochemical processes that have been explored for hydrogen production in solar chemical research include: electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, the use of concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures (2,300–2,600 °C or 4,200–4,700 °F), the use of solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas, and thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants.   Context: Hydrogen production technologies been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures (2,300–2,600 °C or 4,200–4,700 °F). Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods. Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute uses a 1 MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide (ZnO) at temperatures above 1,200 °C (2,200 °F). This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen.   Score: 0.90891093 
Question: What factors have contributed to Melbourne attracting a large proportion of international overseas immigrants and experiencing strong interstate migration?   Answer: The factors that have contributed to Melbourne attracting a large proportion of international overseas immigrants and experiencing strong interstate migration are the more affordable housing and cost of living compared to Sydney and other capitals. Additionally, the population of the Melbourne statistical division has grown by about 70,000 people a year since 2005, which has likely contributed to the influx of immigrants and interstate migration.   Context: Over two-thirds of Melburnians speak only English at home (68.1%). Chinese (mainly Cantonese and Mandarin) is the second-most-common language spoken at home (3.6%), with Greek third, Italian fourth and Vietnamese fifth, each with more than 100,000 speakers.

Question: What impact did Queen Victoria's reliance on Lord Melbourne for advice have on her political decisions during her early reign?   Answer: Queen Victoria's reliance on Lord Melbourne for advice had a significant impact on her political decisions during her early reign. Lord Melbourne was a powerful influence on the inexperienced Queen, and she trusted his advice and guidance. This meant that her decisions were heavily influenced by his political views and opinions, which were often in line with the Whig party.

Question: What are some key insights from anthropologists regarding the concept of identity and the role of boundaries in understanding it?   Answer: Anthropologists have highlighted the importance of boundaries in understanding identity. They have argued that boundaries provide the framework on which the virtual site of identity is built, and that markers of identity help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers. Furthermore, they have suggested that identity is a volatile, flexible and abstract 'thing', and that its manifestations and the ways in which it is exercised are often open to view. Finally, they have noted that misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers, and that an individual can use markers of identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an abstract identity.   Context: Anthropologists have contributed to the debate by shifting the focus of research: One of the first challenges for the researcher wishing to carry out empirical research in this area is to identify an appropriate analytical tool. The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works. In the same way as Barth, in his approach to ethnicity, advocated the critical focus for investigation as being "the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses" (1969:15), social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification. If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent, boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built. They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries.   Score: 0.923153 
Question: What is the role of red and blue light in regulating the circadian rhythm of plants?   Answer: Red and blue light are absorbed by phytochromes and cryptochromes, which are light-sensitive components of the circadian clock. These photoreceptors help to synchronize the internal clocks of plants to their environment and maintain the period length of the clock through a range of light conditions.   Context: Light is the signal by which plants synchronize their internal clocks to their environment and is sensed by a wide variety of photoreceptors. Red and blue light are absorbed through several phytochromes and cryptochromes. One phytochrome, phyA, is the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the dark but rapidly degrades in light to produce Cry1. Phytochromes B–E are more stable with phyB, the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the light. The cryptochrome (cry) gene is also a light-sensitive component of the circadian clock and is thought to be involved both as a photoreceptor and as part of the clock's endogenous pacemaker mechanism. Cryptochromes 1–2 (involved in blue–UVA) help to maintain the period length in the clock through a whole range of light conditions.   Score: 0.908904254

A. Milne's poem for children, "King John's Christmas". These works have portrayed John as an unfavourable character, often as a villain, an effeminate and arrogant coward, or a tyrant.   Context: Contemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John's performance as king, and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards. Historian Jim Bradbury has summarised the contemporary historical opinion of John's positive qualities, observing that John is today usually considered a "hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general". Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as "distasteful, even dangerous personality traits", such as pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty. These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the Victorian era, and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture, primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the Robin Hood legends.

Question: What are the typical weather patterns in Seattle throughout the year, and how does the city adapt to its heaviest rainfall periods?   Answer: The typical weather patterns in Seattle throughout the year are characterized by heavy rainfall during the months of November, December and January, when roughly half of the city's annual rainfall (by volume) occurs. During the rest of the year, light rain and drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation. On occasion, Seattle experiences more significant weather events, such as the Pineapple Express event in 2007, which brought sustained hurricane-force winds and widespread heavy rainfall. The city of Seattle has adapted to its heaviest rainfall periods by implementing various flood control measures, such as constructing levees and dams, and by improving drainage systems. Additionally, the city has implemented public education campaigns to raise awareness of the risks associated with heavy rainfall and flooding.   Context: Seattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during the months of November, December and January, receiving roughly half of its annual rainfall (by volume) during this period. In late fall and early winter, atmospheric rivers (also known as "Pineapple Express" systems), strong frontal systems, and Pacific low pressure systems are common. Light rain & drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year; for instance, on average, less than 1.6 in (41 mm) of rain falls in July and August combined when rain is rare. On occasion, Seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events. One such event occurred on December 2–4, 2007, when sustained hurricane-force winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong Pineapple Express event occurred in the greater Puget Sound area and the western parts of Washington and Oregon. Precipitation totals exceeded 13.8 in (350 mm) in some areas with winds topping out at 209 km/h (130 mph) along coastal Oregon. It became the second wettest event in Seattle history when a little over 130 mm (5.1 in) of rain fell on Seattle in a 24-hour period. Lack of adaptation to the heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage.   Score: 0.892419815 
Question: What are the potential consequences of horizontal gene transfer between different bacterial species, particularly in relation to antibiotic resistance?   Answer: The potential consequences of horizontal gene transfer between different bacterial species, particularly in relation to antibiotic resistance, are the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens, which can lead to the spread of antibiotic resistance. This can make it more difficult to treat bacterial infections, as the bacteria may become resistant to the antibiotics used to treat them.   Context: In ordinary circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.   Score: 0.901784182 
Question: What were the key events and offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in Burma during World War II?   Answer: The key events and offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in Burma during World War II were the formation of Wingate's British Chindits and Merrill's Marauders, both long-range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines, and the series of allied offensives beginning in late 1944. These offensives culminated in the end of Japanese rule in July 1945.   Context: A major battleground, Burma was devastated during World War II. By March 1942, within months after they entered the war, Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon and the British administration had collapsed. A Burmese Executive Administration headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942. Wingate's British Chindits were formed into long-range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines. A similar American unit, Merrill's Marauders, followed the Chindits into the Burmese jungle in 1943. Beginning in late 1944, allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in July 1945. The battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting. Overall, the Japanese lost some 150,000 men in Burma. Only 1,700 prisoners were taken.   Score: 0.896199524

Question: What were the consequences of John's desertions and his decision to have Arthur killed in terms of his freedom to maneuver and support in the region?   Answer: The consequences of John's desertions and his decision to have Arthur killed were a significant reduction in his freedom to maneuver in the region and a decrease in support for him across the region. The desertions of his local allies at the beginning of 1203 limited his ability to act, and the rumours of the manner of Arthur's death further reduced support for John.   Context: Further desertions of John's local allies at the beginning of 1203 steadily reduced John's freedom to manoeuvre in the region. He attempted to convince Pope Innocent III to intervene in the conflict, but Innocent's efforts were unsuccessful. As the situation became worse for John, he appears to have decided to have Arthur killed, with the aim of removing his potential rival and of undermining the rebel movement in Brittany. Arthur had initially been imprisoned at Falaise and was then moved to Rouen. After this, Arthur's fate remains uncertain, but modern historians believe he was murdered by John. The annals of Margam Abbey suggest that "John had captured Arthur and kept him alive in prison for some time in the castle of Rouen ... when John was drunk he slew Arthur with his own hand and tying a heavy stone to the body cast it into the Seine."[nb 7] Rumours of the manner of Arthur's death further reduced support for John across the region.

Question: What are the differences between the Eastern and Western Catalan dialects in terms of pronunciation, and how do they compare to the Valencian dialect?   Answer: The main difference between Eastern and Western Catalan dialects in terms of pronunciation is that in Eastern dialects, unstressed a and e have merged to /ə/, while in Western dialects, they remain distinct as /a/ and /e/. The Valencian dialect is similar to the Eastern dialect in that unstressed a and e have merged to /ə/. However, there are some other differences in pronunciation, verbal morphology, and vocabulary between the Eastern and Western dialects that are not present in the Valencian dialect.   Context: Catalan dialects are relatively uniform, and are mutually intelligible. They are divided into two blocks, Eastern and Western, differing mostly in pronunciation. The terms "Catalan" and "Valencian" (respectively used in Catalonia and the Valencian Community) are two different varieties of the same language.

Question: What factors have contributed to the significant growth of Seattle's foreign-born population between the 1990 and 2000 censuses?   Answer: Factors that have contributed to the significant growth of Seattle's foreign-born population between the 1990 and 2000 censuses include increased job opportunities, improved economic conditions, and the city's reputation as a welcoming and diverse place to live. Additionally, the city's proximity to the Pacific Rim and its reputation as a hub for international trade and commerce have likely attracted immigrants from around the world.   Context: Seattle's foreign-born population grew 40% between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. The Chinese population in the Seattle area has origins in mainland China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. The earliest Chinese-Americans that came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were almost entirely from Guangdong province.

Question: How do network effects impact the electrification of railway systems, particularly in terms of connections with non-electrified lines and the dominance of through traffic from long-haul freight trains?   Answer: Network effects have a significant impact on the electrification of railway systems. Connections with non-electrified lines can be problematic, as through traffic to these lines can lead to the removal of electrifications. To make such connections, time consuming engine switches must occur or expensive dual mode engines must be used. Long-haul freight trains, which are usually running coal, ore, or containers to or from ports, can dominate lines and make it difficult to extend electrification to isolated areas. Additionally, the increasing demand for container traffic, which is more efficient when utilizing the double-stack car, can cause network effect issues with existing electrifications due to insufficient clearance of overhead electrical lines. However, electrification can be built or modified to have sufficient clearance, at additional cost.   Context: Network effects are a large factor with electrification. When converting lines to electric, the connections with other lines must be considered. Some electrifications have subsequently been removed because of the through traffic to non-electrified lines. If through traffic is to have any benefit, time consuming engine switches must occur to make such connections or expensive dual mode engines must be used. This is mostly an issue for long distance trips, but many lines come to be dominated by through traffic from long-haul freight trains (usually running coal, ore, or containers to or from ports). In theory, these trains could enjoy dramatic savings through electrification, but it can be too costly to extend electrification to isolated areas, and unless an entire network is electrified, companies often find that they need to continue use of diesel trains even if sections are electrified. The increasing demand for container traffic which is more efficient when utilizing the double-stack car also has network effect issues with existing electrifications due to insufficient clearance of overhead electrical lines for these trains, but electrification can be built or modified to have sufficient clearance, at additional cost.

Question: How does the development of the seed coat relate to the type of fruit and its function in protecting the embryo and promoting germination?   Answer: The development of the seed coat is directly related to the type of fruit and its function in protecting the embryo and promoting germination. If the fruit is indehiscent, the seed coat is only slightly developed, as the fruit provides protection for the embryo and secures dissemination. However, if the fruit is dehiscent and the seed is exposed, the seed-coat is well developed, and must discharge the functions otherwise executed by the fruit.   Context: The character of the seed coat bears a definite relation to that of the fruit. They protect the embryo and aid in dissemination; they may also directly promote germination. Among plants with indehiscent fruits, in general, the fruit provides protection for the embryo and secures dissemination. In this case, the seed coat is only slightly developed.

These devices employed compound semiconductor chips fabricated with the planar process invented by Dr. Jean Hoerni at Fairchild Semiconductor, and the combination of planar processing for chip fabrication and innovative packaging methods enabled the team at Fairchild led by optoelectronics pioneer Thomas Brandt to achieve the needed cost reductions.   Context: The first commercial LEDs were commonly used as replacements for incandescent and neon indicator lamps, and in seven-segment displays, first in expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronics test equipment, then later in such appliances as TVs, radios, telephones, calculators, as well as watches (see list of signal uses). Until 1968, visible and infrared LEDs were extremely costly, in the order of US$200 per unit, and so had little practical use. The Monsanto Company was the first organization to mass-produce visible LEDs, using gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) in 1968 to produce red LEDs suitable for indicators. Hewlett Packard (HP) introduced LEDs in 1968, initially using GaAsP supplied by Monsanto. These red LEDs were bright enough only for use as indicators, as the light output was not enough to illuminate an area. Readouts in calculators were so small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible. Later, other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment.

Question: What were some significant works during the Age of Enlightenment that aimed to make scientific theory and knowledge accessible to a wider audience, particularly women, and what impact did they have on the dissemination of scientific ideas?   Answer: During the Age of Enlightenment, several significant works were produced that aimed to make scientific theory and knowledge accessible to a wider audience, particularly women. Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686) was the first of these works, and it was specifically produced for women with an interest in scientific writing. This book inspired a variety of similar works, which were written in a discursive style that was easier to understand than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as "a Work entirely New" that would include "short and easie  [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables." The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was Eléments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university. Francesco Algarotti, writing for a growing female audience, published Il Newtonianism per le dame, which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by Elizabeth Carter.

Answer: During the Yuan dynasty, Tibet had nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols had a structural and administrative rule over the region. The Mongols enforced their rule with rare military interventions, creating a "diarchic structure" with power primarily in favor of the Mongols. Mongolian prince Khuden gained temporal power in Tibet in the 1240s and sponsored Sakya Pandita, whose seat became the capital of Tibet. Drogön Chögyal Phagpa, Sakya Pandita's nephew, became Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty. This allowed the Mongols to influence religious and regional political affairs in Tibet, as they had the power to appoint religious leaders and control regional politics.   Context: Tibet retained nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a "diarchic structure" under the Yuan emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols. Mongolian prince Khuden gained temporal power in Tibet in the 1240s and sponsored Sakya Pandita, whose seat became the capital of Tibet.

Question: What are some potential applications of using LEDs for optical communication, as demonstrated by Braunstein's setup in 1957?   Answer: Some potential applications of using LEDs for optical communication, as demonstrated by Braunstein's setup in 1957, include remote controls, opto-isolators, and optical fiber and free space optics communications.   Context: In 1957, Braunstein further demonstrated that the rudimentary devices could be used for non-radio communication across a short distance. As noted by Kroemer Braunstein".. had set up a simple optical communications link: Music emerging from a record player was used via suitable electronics to modulate the forward current of a GaAs diode. The emitted light was detected by a PbS diode some distance away. This signal was fed into an audio amplifier, and played back by a loudspeaker. Intercepting the beam stopped the music. We had a great deal of fun playing with this setup." This setup presaged the use of LEDs for optical communication applications.   Score: 0.920747 
Question: What factors contributed to the resurgence of neoclassical architecture after a period of modern architectural dominance?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the resurgence of neoclassical architecture after a period of modern architectural dominance include the movement of New Urbanism, postmodern architecture's embrace of classical elements, and the work of architects such as Thomas Gordon Smith who began to consider classicism seriously. Additionally, the development of programs dedicated to classical architecture at universities such as the University of Notre Dame, the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University, and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a new generation of classical architects.   Context: After a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), neoclassicism has seen somewhat of a resurgence. This rebirth can be traced to the movement of New Urbanism and postmodern architecture's embrace of classical elements as ironic, especially in light of the dominance of Modernism. While some continued to work with classicism as ironic, some architects such as Thomas Gordon Smith, began to consider classicism seriously. While some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the University of Virginia, no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and Duncan Stroik at the University of Notre Dame that continues successfully. Programs at the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence. Today one can find numerous buildings embracing neoclassical style, since a generation of architects trained in this discipline shapes urban planning.   Score: 0.893780291 
Question: What are some potential negative consequences of affirmative action policies, according to Terry Eastland and Thomas Sowell?   Answer: According to Terry Eastland and Thomas Sowell, some potential negative consequences of affirmative action policies include: the benefits of affirmative action going to those who do not need it, mostly middle class minorities; the stigma of affirmative action creating feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities; encouraging non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups to take advantage of group preference policies; reducing the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best; and engendering animosity toward preferred groups.   Context: Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, "Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147   Score: 0.89623332 
Question: What historical factors contributed to the intermarriage between African Americans and Indigenous Americans during the era of slavery in the United States?   Answer: The primary factor that contributed to the intermarriage between African Americans and Indigenous Americans during the era of slavery in the United States was the institution of slavery itself. The primary exposure that Africans and Indigenous Americans had to each other came through the institution of slavery. Indigenous Americans learned that Africans had what Indigenous Americans considered 'Great Medicine' in their bodies because Africans were virtually immune to the Old-World diseases that were decimating most native populations. Because of this, many tribes encouraged marriage between the two groups, to create stronger, healthier children from the unions. Additionally, European colonists created treaties with Indigenous American tribes requesting the return of any runaway slaves, which further increased the interaction between the two groups.   Context: European colonists created treaties with Indigenous American tribes requesting the return of any runaway slaves. For example, in 1726, the British governor of New York exacted a promise from the Iroquois to return all runaway slaves who had joined them. This same promise was extracted from the Huron Nation in 1764, and from the Delaware Nation in 1765, though there is no record of slaves ever being returned. Numerous advertisements requested the return of African Americans who had married Indigenous Americans or who spoke an Indigenous American language.

Question: What evidence supports the fraternal birth order (FBO) effect and its prenatal origin, and what is the proposed mechanism behind this effect?   Answer: Evidence supporting the FBO effect and its prenatal origin comes from research suggesting that it may be of immunological origin, caused by a maternal immune reaction against a substance crucial to male fetal development during pregnancy. This process, known as the maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH), would begin when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth. These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment. From here, the anti-male bodies would then cross the blood/brain barrier (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, causing the exposed son to be more attracted to men over women.   Context: Known as the fraternal birth order (FBO) effect, this theory has been backed up by strong evidence of its prenatal origin, although no evidence thus far has linked it to an exact prenatal mechanism. However, research suggests that this may be of immunological origin, caused by a maternal immune reaction against a substance crucial to male fetal development during pregnancy, which becomes increasingly likely after every male gestation. As a result of this immune effect, alterations in later-born males' prenatal development have been thought to occur. This process, known as the maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH), would begin when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth.

Question: What were the consequences and reactions to the conduct of the Chinese security guards during the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay in London?   Answer: The conduct of the Chinese security guards during the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay in London was met with strong criticism and condemnation. Home Secretary Jacqui Smith officially complained to the Beijing Organising Committee about the conduct of the tracksuit-clad Chinese security guards, and London Mayor Ken Livingstone and Lord Coe, chairman of the London Olympic Committee, both described them as "thugs". The Metropolitan police briefing paper revealed that security for the torch relay cost £750,000 and the participation of the Chinese security team had been agreed in advance, despite the Mayor stating that they were not aware of the security team beforehand.   Context: The attacks on the torch in London and Paris were described as "despicable" by the Chinese government, condemning them as "deliberate disruptions... who gave no thought to the Olympic spirit or the laws of Britain and France" and who "tarnish the lofty Olympic spirit", and vowed they would continue with the relay and not allow the protests to "impede the Olympic spirit". Large-scale counter-protests by overseas Chinese and foreign-based Chinese nationals became prevalent in later segments of the relay. In San Francisco, the number of supporters were much more than the number of protesters, and in Australia, Japan, South Korea, the counter-protesters overwhelmed the protesters.

Question: What impact did Arnold Schwarzenegger's lack of political experience and unknown views have on his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of California?   Answer: Arnold Schwarzenegger's lack of political experience and unknown views had a significant impact on his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of California. His lack of experience and unknown views made it difficult for voters to make an informed decision about his candidacy, as they had no way of knowing what his policies and views would be if elected. This lack of information made it difficult for Schwarzenegger to gain the trust of voters, and likely contributed to his decision to decline to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates.   Context: Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003 episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the "Governator" (referring to The Terminator movies, see above) and "The Running Man" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election "Total Recall" (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger).

Question: What are some staining procedures used in microbiology to identify infectious agents and how do they contribute to the taxonomic classification of microbes?   Answer: Staining procedures used in microbiology to identify infectious agents include the Gram stain and the acid-fast stain. The Gram stain is used to classify bacteria into the groups Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, both of which contain many significant human pathogens. The acid-fast staining procedure is used to identify the Actinobacterial genera Mycobacterium and Nocardia. These staining procedures are used in the taxonomic classification of microbes by providing a way to differentiate between different types of bacteria based on their response to the staining procedure.   Context: Other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents. Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye. A cell is normally transparent under a microscope, and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background. Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size, shape, internal and external components and its associations with other cells. The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of microbes as well. Two methods, the Gram stain and the acid-fast stain, are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease. The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, both of which contain many significant human pathogens.

Question: What are some key concepts in cultural studies that were influenced by Marxism and how did they relate consumption goods and leisure activities to class relations and the organization of production?   Answer: Key concepts in cultural studies that were influenced by Marxism include the idea that consumption goods and leisure activities are determined by relations of production. This means that the patterns of consumption and leisure are linked to class relations and the organization of production. For example, certain leisure activities may be more accessible to certain classes than others, and certain consumption goods may be more affordable to certain classes than others. This can lead to disparities in access to leisure activities and consumption goods, which can further reinforce class divisions.   Context: In the United Kingdom, sociologists and other scholars influenced by Marxism, such as Stuart Hall (1932–2014) and Raymond Williams (1921–1988), developed cultural studies. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified "culture" with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, food, sports, and clothing). Nevertheless, they saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by relations of production, which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.

Question: What were some significant military and technological developments during the Carolingian period in relation to infantry, cavalry, and weaponry?   Answer: During the Carolingian period, there were significant military and technological developments in relation to infantry, cavalry, and weaponry. The importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline, with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry. The use of militia-type levies of the free population also declined. In terms of military technology, the return of the crossbow was a major development, as it had been known in Roman times and reappeared as a military weapon during the last part of the Early Middle Ages. The introduction of the stirrup also increased the effectiveness of cavalry as shock troops. Finally, the horseshoe allowed horses to be used in rocky terrain, which had implications beyond the military.   Context: The importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline during the early Carolingian period, with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry. The use of militia-type levies of the free population declined over the Carolingian period. Although much of the Carolingian armies were mounted, a large proportion during the early period appear to have been mounted infantry, rather than true cavalry. One exception was Anglo-Saxon England, where the armies were still composed of regional levies, known as the fyrd, which were led by the local elites. In military technology, one of the main changes was the return of the crossbow, which had been known in Roman times and reappeared as a military weapon during the last part of the Early Middle Ages. Another change was the introduction of the stirrup, which increased the effectiveness of cavalry as shock troops. A technological advance that had implications beyond the military was the horseshoe, which allowed horses to be used in rocky terrain.   Score: 0.91966778 
Question: What factors led to the transition from highly mobile hunter-gatherer societies to more regionally focused adaptations during the Archaic period in the Americas?   Answer: The transition from highly mobile hunter-gatherer societies to more regionally focused adaptations during the Archaic period in the Americas was largely driven by environmental changes. The warmer and more arid climate, as well as the disappearance of the last megafauna, meant that individual groups had to focus on the resources available to them locally. This led to a pattern of increasing regional generalization, with reliance less on hunting and gathering and more on a mixed economy of small game, fish, seasonally wild vegetables, and harvested plant foods.   Context: The Archaic period in the Americas saw a changing environment featuring a warmer more arid climate and the disappearance of the last megafauna. The majority of population groups at this time were still highly mobile hunter-gatherers; but now individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally, thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization like, the Southwest, Arctic, Poverty, Dalton and Plano traditions. This regional adaptations would become the norm, with reliance less on hunting and gathering, with a more mixed economy of small game, fish, seasonally wild vegetables and harvested plant foods.

Question: What evidence or arguments support the concept of materialism as a form of philosophical monism?   Answer: Materialism as a form of philosophical monism is supported by the idea that all phenomena, including mental phenomena and consciousness, are identical with material interactions. This suggests that the physical world is the only reality and that all phenomena can be explained through physical processes. Additionally, materialism is supported by the fact that it is possible to observe and measure physical phenomena, such as the behavior of particles, and to use this data to make predictions about the behavior of other physical phenomena. This suggests that physical phenomena are the basis of all reality.

Question: What are some programming languages that use UTF-32 as their internal representation for strings and characters?   Answer: Some programming languages that use UTF-32 as their internal representation for strings and characters include Seed7 and Python.   Context: In UTF-32 and UCS-4, one 32-bit code value serves as a fairly direct representation of any character's code point (although the endianness, which varies across different platforms, affects how the code value manifests as an octet sequence). In the other encodings, each code point may be represented by a variable number of code values. UTF-32 is widely used as an internal representation of text in programs (as opposed to stored or transmitted text), since every Unix operating system that uses the gcc compilers to generate software uses it as the standard "wide character" encoding. Some programming languages, such as Seed7, use UTF-32 as internal representation for strings and characters. Recent versions of the Python programming language (beginning with 2.2) may also be configured to use UTF-32 as the representation for Unicode strings, effectively disseminating such encoding in high-level coded software.

Question: What impact did Harper Lee's personal experiences with loss and mental illness have on the creation of the character Atticus in "To Kill a Mockingbird"?   Answer: Harper Lee's personal experiences with loss and mental illness likely had a significant impact on the creation of the character Atticus in "To Kill a Mockingbird". Lee had lost her mother to mental illness and her father two years before the publication of the novel. Atticus Finch is widely seen as a model of integrity for the legal profession, and his character is often seen as a representation of Lee's own father. It is likely that Lee drew on her own experiences with loss and mental illness to create a character that embodied the values of her father and the strength of her mother.

Question: What are some of the reasons that contribute to Utrecht's high percentage of bicycle usage compared to other modes of transportation within the city?   Answer: 1. Utrecht has an extensive network of cycle paths, making cycling safe and convenient. 2. Bicycles are affordable and accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. 3. The City Council has invested in building the world's largest bicycle parking station, providing a secure place to store bicycles. 4. The city has a culture of cycling, with many people using bicycles as their primary mode of transportation.   Context: Like most Dutch cities, Utrecht has an extensive network of cycle paths, making cycling safe and popular. 33% of journeys within the city are by bicycle, more than any other mode of transport. (Cars, for example, account for 30% of trips). Bicycles are used by young and old people, and by individuals and families. They are mostly traditional, upright, steel-framed bicycles, with few or no gears. There are also barrow bikes, for carrying shopping or small children. As thousands of bicycles are parked haphazardly in town, creating an eyesore but also impeding pedestrians, the City Council decided in 2014 to build the world's largest bicycle parking station, near the Central Railway Station.

Question: What were the different categories of nobility within the Polish landed gentry and how did land ownership play a role in their status?   Answer: The Polish landed gentry was composed of three categories of nobility: magnates, middle nobility, and lesser nobility. Magnates were the highest ranking nobility and owned the most land. Middle nobility owned less land than magnates, but more than the lesser nobility. The lesser nobility had the least amount of land, but still owned at least part of a village. Land ownership was the primary factor in determining the status of the nobility within the Polish landed gentry. Those who owned land were considered nobility, while those who did not own land were not considered nobility, even if they were burgesses of certain privileged royal cities.   Context: Note that the Polish landed gentry (ziemianie or ziemiaństwo) was composed of any nobility that owned lands: thus of course the magnates, the middle nobility and that lesser nobility that had at least part of the village. As manorial lordships were also opened to burgesses of certain privileged royal cities, not all landed gentry had a hereditary title of nobility.   Score: 0.888667345

Question: What advantages does vinyl offer for DJs compared to CDs or digital formats, and how have technological advancements bridged the gap between the two?   Answer: Vinyl offers DJs direct manipulation of the medium, allowing them to perform techniques such as slip-cueing, beatmatching, and scratching. Technological advancements such as DJ software and time-encoded vinyl have bridged the gap between vinyl and CDs or digital formats, allowing DJs to perform the same techniques on CDs or digital formats as they can on vinyl. These advancements have also allowed DJs to perform more advanced techniques, such as looping and pitch shifting, which were not possible on vinyl.   Context: Many electronic dance music and hip hop releases today are still preferred on vinyl; however, digital copies are still widely available. This is because for disc jockeys ("DJs"), vinyl has an advantage over the CD: direct manipulation of the medium. DJ techniques such as slip-cueing, beatmatching, and scratching originated on turntables. With CDs or compact audio cassettes one normally has only indirect manipulation options, e.g., the play, stop, and pause buttons. With a record one can place the stylus a few grooves farther in or out, accelerate or decelerate the turntable, or even reverse its direction, provided the stylus, record player, and record itself are built to withstand it.

Question: What were the key factors that contributed to the success of the rebel militia in gaining control over western Libya and ultimately ending Gaddafist power?   Answer: The key factors that contributed to the success of the rebel militia in gaining control over western Libya and ultimately ending Gaddafist power were the support of NATO in the form of air cover, the support of the Amazigh (Berber) communities of the Nafusa Mountains, the recognition of the National Transitional Council (NTC) by the Arab League as the legitimate representative of the Libyan state, and the increasing unpopularity of Idris' government due to its centralization of the country's federal system and corruption in the oil industry. Additionally, the anti-western sentiment that had been growing in Libya since the 1967 Six-Day War with Israel was a major factor in the success of the rebel militia.   Context: Now with NATO support in the form of air cover, the rebel militia pushed westward, defeating loyalist armies and securing control of the centre of the country. Gaining the support of Amazigh (Berber) communities of the Nafusa Mountains, who had long been persecuted as non-Arabic speakers under Gaddafi, the NTC armies surrounded Gaddafi loyalists in several key areas of western Libya.

Answer: Some of the key factors that contribute to the differing interpretations of the nature of relations between Tibet and the Ming dynasty among Chinese scholars and scholars outside of China include: 1. The application of Westphalian sovereignty to a time when the concept did not exist. 2. The Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders and Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles. 3. The renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. 4.

Question: What are the different phases of digestion and how do they contribute to the overall process?   Answer: The different phases of digestion are the cephalic phase, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and defecation. The cephalic phase is the first phase of digestion and involves the production of saliva and digestive enzymes in the mouth and stomach. Mechanical digestion involves the chewing of food and mixing it with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches. Chemical digestion involves the breaking down of food through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes in the stomach. Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, where nutrients are taken up by the body. Finally, defecation is the process of eliminating waste from the body. Throughout the entire process, muscle movement is required to swallow and move food through the digestive system. This movement requires energy, which is an "overhead charge" on the energy made available from absorbed substances. These differences in overhead cost can have a significant influence on lifestyle, behavior, and physical structures.   Context: In mammals, preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach. Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed, and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches. The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes.

Answer: Some contemporary uses of uranium that exploit its unique nuclear properties include nuclear power reactors, nuclear weapons, kinetic energy penetrators, and armor plating. Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring fissile isotope, while uranium-238 and uranium-233 are both fissionable by fast neutrons and can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. These isotopes can maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction, which generates the heat in nuclear power reactors and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (238U) is also used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating.   Context: Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons.

Answer: The Teletype Model 33 ASR had several influential features that contributed to the interpretation of ASCII characters, including its paper tape reader/punch option, its machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 (Delete), and its literal interpretation of Control-G (BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator). Additionally, its keytop for the O key showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of underscore), which led to a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as "delete previous character" being adopted by many early timesharing systems.   Context: Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the Teletype Model 33 ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 (Delete) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of underscore), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as "delete previous character" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.

Question: How does Martin Luther's belief in the Immaculate Conception differ from traditional Catholic doctrine?   Answer: Martin Luther believed that Mary was born in sin of sinful parents, but was sanctified and purified by the Holy Spirit so that she was able to give birth to a pure child. Traditional Catholic doctrine states that Mary was preserved from any stain of original sin from the first instance of her conception, and was granted a singular grace and privilege by God in view of the merits of Jesus Christ.   Context: Martin Luther, who initiated the Protestant Reformation, said: "Mother Mary, like us, was born in sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true, natural human being of flesh and blood, just as we. However, he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are. For in that moment when she conceived, she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit, at once God and truly man, in one person." Some Lutherans, such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, support the doctrine.   Score: 0.887062371 
Question: What significant factors influenced the establishment and boundaries of Tennessee as the 16th state in the United States?   Answer: The significant factors that influenced the establishment and boundaries of Tennessee as the 16th state in the United States were the Constitution of the State of Tennessee, the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, the Appalachian Mountains, the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota, the Unicoi Mountain, and the possibility of future land acquisition from west of the Mississippi River.   Context: Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796 as the 16th state. It was the first state created from territory under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government. Apart from the former Thirteen Colonies only Vermont and Kentucky predate Tennessee's statehood, and neither was ever a federal territory. The state boundaries, according to the Constitution of the State of Tennessee, Article I, Section 31, stated that the beginning point for identifying the boundary was the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it, and basically ran the extreme heights of mountain chains through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee past the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota, thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (Unicoi Mountain) to the southern boundary of the state; all the territory, lands and waters lying west of said line are included in the boundaries and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee. Part of the provision also stated that the limits and jurisdiction of the state would include future land acquisition, referencing possible land trade with other states, or the acquisition of territory from west of the Mississippi River.

Question: What are some examples of ligatures or abbreviations in Chinese characters that represent whole words rather than syllable-morphemes?   Answer: Examples of ligatures or abbreviations in Chinese characters that represent whole words rather than syllable-morphemes include héwén (合文), héshū (合書) and hétǐzì (合体字). Additionally, two-syllable Chinese characters (双音节汉字, 雙音節漢字) are a special case of combining two characters.   Context: In certain cases compound words and set phrases may be contracted into single characters. Some of these can be considered logograms, where characters represent whole words rather than syllable-morphemes, though these are generally instead considered ligatures or abbreviations (similar to scribal abbreviations, such as & for "et"), and as non-standard. These do see use, particularly in handwriting or decoration, but also in some cases in print. In Chinese, these ligatures are called héwén (合文), héshū (合書) or hétǐzì (合体字), and in the special case of combining two characters, these are known as "two-syllable Chinese characters" (双音节汉字, 雙音節漢字).

Question: What are some natural sources of hydrogen gas and what is its significance in the context of Earth's atmosphere?   Answer: Natural sources of hydrogen gas include bacteria and algae, flatus, and hydrocarbons and water. Its significance in the context of Earth's atmosphere is that it is very rare, with only 1 ppm by volume, due to its light weight, which enables it to escape from Earth's gravity more easily than heavier gases. However, it is still the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface.   Context: Under ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H2. However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (1 ppm by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from Earth's gravity more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface, mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water.

Question: What were the challenges faced during the service trials of the Bofors anti-aircraft warfare system in terms of ranging and tracking high-speed targets?   Answer: The challenges faced during the service trials of the Bofors anti-aircraft warfare system in terms of ranging and tracking high-speed targets were that at short range, the apparent target area was relatively large, the trajectory was flat and the time of flight was short, making it difficult to correct lead by watching the tracers. At long range, the aircraft remained in firing range for a long time, so the necessary calculations could in theory be done by slide rules, but small errors in distance caused large errors in shell fall height and detonation time, making exact ranging crucial.   Context: Service trials demonstrated another problem however: that ranging and tracking the new high-speed targets was almost impossible. At short range, the apparent target area is relatively large, the trajectory is flat and the time of flight is short, allowing to correct lead by watching the tracers. At long range, the aircraft remains in firing range for a long time, so the necessary calculations can in theory be done by slide rules - though, because small errors in distance cause large errors in shell fall height and detonation time, exact ranging is crucial.

Question: What factors have contributed to the presence of Russian speakers in Finland, and how has the population of Russian speakers evolved over time?   Answer: The presence of Russian speakers in Finland is largely due to the Grand Duchy of Finland's inclusion in the Russian Empire from 1809 to 1918. This resulted in a number of Russian speakers remaining in Finland after the Empire's dissolution. The population of Russian speakers has evolved over time, with a majority of recent immigrants who moved to Finland in the 1990s and later, as well as a smaller number of late 19th century and 20th century immigrants or their descendants. According to a 2014 estimate from the World Factbook, Russian is spoken by 1.4% of the population of Finland.   Context: As the Grand Duchy of Finland was part of the Russian Empire from 1809 to 1918, a number of Russian speakers have remained in Finland. There are 33,400 Russian-speaking Finns, amounting to 0.6% of the population.

Question: What were the measures taken by the state of Chihuahua in the 1840s to strengthen its defense lines and prepare for a possible war?   Answer: The state of Chihuahua took measures to strengthen its defense lines and prepare for a possible war in the 1840s by sending supplies of weapons to fully equip the military, improving efficiency at the presidios, organizing the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border, enlisting 6,000 men to serve along the border, dedicating important state resources to gain economic concessions from the people and loans from many municipalities, and equipping and organizing a large volunteer militia.   Context: The state seemed at relative calm compared to the rest of the country due to its close ties to the United States until 1841. In 1843 the possibility of war was anticipated by the state government and it began to reinforce the defense lines along the political boundary with Texas. Supplies of weapons were sent to fully equip the military and took steps to improve efficiency at the presidios. Later, the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border were organized by the state which were made up of: light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials at the price of 160,603 pesos per year. During the beginning of the 1840s, private citizens took it upon themselves to stop the commercial caravans of supplies from the United States, but being so far away from the large suppliers in central Mexico the caravan was allowed to continue in March 1844. Continuing to anticipate a war, the state legislature on July 11, 1846 by decree enlisted 6,000 men to serve along the border; during that time Ángel Trías quickly rose to power by portraying zealous anti-American rhetoric. Trías took the opportunity to dedicate important state resources to gain economic concessions from the people and loans from many municipalities in preparation to defend the state; he used all the money he received to equip and organize a large volunteer militia.

Question: What impact does the practice of BYU athletes serving on full-time missions for two years have on the average age of their players compared to other schools?   Answer: The practice of BYU athletes serving on full-time missions for two years has caused BYU athletes to be older on average than other schools' players.   Context: BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the "Cougars", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.

Answer: 17-β-oestradiol and testosterone have been shown to have an effect on the development and regulation of the immune system during adolescence. There is evidence that these hormones can directly affect the primary and secondary sexual characteristics, as well as increase the risk of developing pubescent and post-pubescent autoimmunity. Additionally, cell surface receptors on B cells and macrophages may detect sex hormones in the system, which can further affect the development and regulation of the immune system.

Question: What were the factors that contributed to the Seleucid Empire's increasing aggression and successful attempts to conquer the Greek world, and how did their control over the former Persian Empire and reassembly of Alexander the Great's empire play a role in their strength compared to the Macedonians?   Answer: The Seleucid Empire's increasing aggression and successful attempts to conquer the Greek world were largely due to the weakening of Egypt and Macedonia, which left them as the dominant power in the region. The Seleucids had control over much of the former Persian Empire, which gave them a much larger and more powerful army than the Macedonians had ever had. This allowed them to quickly and easily conquer much of the Greek world. Additionally, the Seleucids had almost entirely reassembled Alexander the Great's former empire, which gave them access to the resources and manpower of the former Persian Empire. This allowed them to build a much larger and more powerful army than the Macedonians had ever had, and gave them a much greater ability to conquer the Greek world.   Context: With Egypt and Macedonia weakened, the Seleucid Empire made increasingly aggressive and successful attempts to conquer the entire Greek world. Now not only Rome's allies against Philip, but even Philip himself, sought a Roman alliance against the Seleucids. The situation was made worse by the fact that Hannibal was now a chief military advisor to the Seleucid emperor, and the two were believed to be planning an outright conquest not just of Greece, but of Rome itself. The Seleucids were much stronger than the Macedonians had ever been, because they controlled much of the former Persian Empire, and by now had almost entirely reassembled Alexander the Great's former empire.

Answer: Western philosophy's perspective on emotions shifted from the stoic theories, which viewed emotions as a hindrance to reason and virtue, to the Aristotelian view, which saw emotions as an essential component of virtue. This shift in perspective had a lasting influence on the study of emotions in subsequent centuries. In the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas Aquinas in particular. In the 19th century, emotions were studied more frequently from an empiricist psychiatric perspective, which was heavily influenced by the Aristotelian view.   Context: Western philosophy regarded emotion in varying ways. In stoic theories it was seen as a hindrance to reason and therefore a hindrance to virtue. Aristotle believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue. In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas Aquinas in particular. There are also theories of emotions in the works of philosophers such as René Descartes, Niccolò Machiavelli, Baruch Spinoza and David Hume. In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an empiricist psychiatric perspective.   Score: 0.919843376 
Question: What were the upbringing and family background of Arnold Schwarzenegger like?   Answer: Arnold Schwarzenegger was born in Thal, Austria to Gustav Schwarzenegger and Aurelia Schwarzenegger. His father was the local chief of police and had served in World War II as a Hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the Nazi Party in 1938. His parents were very strict and the family attended Mass every Sunday. Gustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold, which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child. Despite this, Schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death. Money was a problem in their household, but Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator. At school, Schwarzenegger was apparently in the middle but stood out for his "cheerful, good-humored and exuberant" character.   Context: Gustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard (July 17, 1946 – May 20, 1971), over Arnold. His favoritism was "strong and blatant," which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child. Schwarzenegger has said his father had "no patience for listening or understanding your problems." Schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death. In later life, Schwarzenegger commissioned the Simon Wiesenthal Center to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of Gustav's being involved in atrocities, despite Gustav's membership in the Nazi Party and SA. Schwarzenegger's father's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California recall campaign.

Question: What were some of the reasons for the commercial failure of RCA Victor's long-playing records in 1931?   Answer: 1. Lack of affordable, reliable consumer playback equipment 2. Consumer wariness during the Great Depression 3. Financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period 4. RCA's own parched revenues   Context: In 1931, RCA Victor launched the first commercially available vinyl long-playing record, marketed as program-transcription discs. These revolutionary discs were designed for playback at 33 1⁄3 rpm and pressed on a 30 cm diameter flexible plastic disc, with a duration of about ten minutes playing time per side. RCA Victor's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable, reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the Great Depression. Because of financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period (and RCA's own parched revenues), Victor's long-playing records were discontinued by early 1933.

Question: What factors contributed to the development and adoption of regular script as the dominant modern Chinese script, and how did it evolve from earlier forms such as semi-cursive and neo-clerical scripts?   Answer: The development and adoption of regular script as the dominant modern Chinese script was attributed to Zhong Yao of the Eastern Han to Cao Wei period (c. 151–230 AD). It is believed that he was a contributor to its gradual formation, but not the sole creator. The earliest surviving pieces written in regular script are copies of Yao's works, including at least one copied by Wang Xizhi. This new script developed out of a neatly written form of early semi-cursive, with the addition of the pause (頓/顿 dùn) technique to end horizontal strokes, plus heavy tails on strokes which are written to the downward-right diagonal. This early regular script emerged from a neat, formal form of semi-cursive, which had itself emerged from neo-clerical (a simplified, convenient form of clerical script). It then matured further in the Eastern Jin dynasty in the hands of the "Sage of Calligraphy", Wang Xizhi, and his son Wang Xianzhi. It was not, however, in widespread use at that time, and most writers continued using neo-clerical, or a somewhat semi-cursive form of it, for daily writing, while the conservative bafen clerical script remained in use on some stelae, alongside some semi-cursive, but primarily neo-clerical.   Context: Regular script has been attributed to Zhong Yao, of the Eastern Han to Cao Wei period (c. 151–230 AD), who has been called the "father of regular script". However, some scholars postulate that one person alone could not have developed a new script which was universally adopted, but could only have been a contributor to its gradual formation. The earliest surviving pieces written in regular script are copies of Yao's works, including at least one copied by Wang Xizhi. This new script, which is the dominant modern Chinese script, developed out of a neatly written form of early semi-cursive, with addition of the pause (頓/顿 dùn) technique to end horizontal strokes, plus heavy tails on strokes which are written to the downward-right diagonal.

Question: What are some of the major historical influences on the culture of Greece, and how have these influences shaped its multi-faceted culture?   Answer: The major historical influences on the culture of Greece include the Mycenaean, Classical, Roman, Eastern Roman or Byzantine, Latin, Frankish, Ottoman, Venetian, Genoese, and British Empires. These influences have shaped the multi-faceted culture of Greece in a variety of ways. The Mycenaean and Classical Empires were responsible for the development of the Greek language, literature, and philosophy, while the Roman Empire brought with it the Latin language and the spread of Christianity. The Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire was responsible for the preservation of Greek culture and the spread of Orthodox Christianity. The Latin and Frankish states, the Ottoman Empire, the Venetian Republic, the Genoese Republic, and the British Empire all had their own unique contributions to the culture of Greece, such as the introduction of new foods, customs, and traditions. Finally, the Greek War of Independence revitalised Greece and gave birth to a single, cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture.   Context: The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years, beginning in Mycenaean Greece and continuing most notably into Classical Greece, through the influence of the Roman Empire and its Greek Eastern continuation, the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Other cultures and nations, such as the Latin and Frankish states, the Ottoman Empire, the Venetian Republic, the Genoese Republic, and the British Empire have also left their influence on modern Greek culture, although historians credit the Greek War of Independence with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single, cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture.

Question: What is Whitehead's critique of classical concepts such as "quality", "matter", and "form", and how does he argue that they fail to adequately account for change and overlook the active and experiential nature of the world's basic elements?   Answer: Whitehead's critique of classical concepts such as "quality", "matter", and "form" is that they fail to adequately account for change and overlook the active and experiential nature of the world's basic elements. He argues that these concepts are useful abstractions, but are not the world's basic building blocks. He believes that enduring objects are not the most real and fundamental things in the universe, and that materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete. He instead proposes an event-based or "process" ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another. He also argues that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, and that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions manifest some degree of experience.   Context: In Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as "quality", "matter", and "form" are problematic. These "classical" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world. They are useful abstractions, but are not the world's basic building blocks. What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events. After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience. These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a "society" of events. By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the "fallacy of misplaced concreteness").

Question: What were some of the challenges Alexander Graham Bell faced in the early years of the Bell Telephone Company, and how did he overcome them?   Answer: Alexander Graham Bell faced a number of challenges in the early years of the Bell Telephone Company, including 587 court challenges to its patents. Bell was able to overcome these challenges by using his laboratory notes and family letters to establish a long lineage to his experiments, and by successfully fighting off the lawsuits generated by Elisha Gray and Amos Dolbear. Bell was also able to use personal correspondence to Bell from Gray and Dolbear to weaken their later claims.   Context: As is sometimes common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous developments can occur, as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone. Over a period of 18 years, the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents, including five that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage. Bell's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments.

In personal correspondence to Bell, both Gray and Dolbear had acknowledged his prior work, which considerably weakened their later claims.   Score: 0.882217169 
Question: What are some unique characteristics of the brain that make it the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body?   Answer: Some unique characteristics of the brain that make it the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body include its large number of neurons (estimated to be 15-33 billion in a typical human), its ability to communicate with other neurons through synapses, and its ability to send signals to distant parts of the body through axons. Additionally, the brain is responsible for controlling and coordinating the body's functions, such as movement, balance, and sensory perception.   Context: The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.

Question: What evidence exists regarding Edmund Burke's contributions to the influential Annual Register publication and its impact on his opinions and political influence?   Answer: Evidence exists that Burke was the chief editor of the Annual Register publication until at least 1789 and that no other writer contributed to it before 1766. Burke's contributions to the publication are unclear, but it is known that various authors evaluated the international political events of the previous year in the publication. Burke's opinions and political influence were greatly impacted by the Annual Register, as evidenced by the praise from William Ewart Gladstone, Richard Cobden, Lord Acton, Lord Macaulay, John Morley, and Francis Hirst. Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France, which was published in the Annual Register, became his best known and most influential work, and a manifesto for Conservative thinking.   Context: During the year following that contract, with Dodsley, Burke founded the influential Annual Register, a publication in which various authors evaluated the international political events of the previous year. The extent to which Burke contributed to the Annual Register is unclear: in his biography of Burke, Robert Murray quotes the Register as evidence of Burke's opinions, yet Philip Magnus in his biography does not cite it directly as a reference.

Question: What evidence supports the divergence of the Galloanserae superorder before or after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, and how do molecular dating and fossil evidence contribute to the understanding of this divergence?   Answer: Molecular dating suggests that the divergence of the Galloanserae superorder occurred during the Cretaceous period, while fossil evidence suggests that the divergence occurred during the Cenozoic period. This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while fossil evidence supports a Cenozoic radiation. Attempts to reconcile the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial, but recent results show that all the extant groups of birds originated from only a small handful of species that survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction. This suggests that the divergence of the Galloanserae superorder occurred before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event.   Context: The earliest divergence within the Neognathes was that of the Galloanserae, the superorder containing the Anseriformes (ducks, geese, swans and screamers) and the Galliformes (the pheasants, grouse, and their allies, together with the mound builders and the guans and their allies). The earliest fossil remains of true birds come from the possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago, but the dates for the actual splits are much debated by scientists. The Aves are agreed to have evolved in the Cretaceous, and the split between the Galloanseri from other Neognathes occurred before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, but there are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining Neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs. This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while fossil evidence supports a Cenozoic radiation.

Answer: During the 14th and 15th centuries, Myanmar experienced a period of political fragmentation that lasted for 250 years. This period saw the arrival of Shan migrants who stayed behind after the Mongol invasions, and the emergence of several competing Shan States that came to dominate the arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. In the late 14th century, two sizeable powers, Ava Kingdom and Hanthawaddy Kingdom, emerged in the valley. In the west, the politically fragmented Arakan was under the influence of its stronger neighbours until the Kingdom of Mrauk U unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437.

Question: How have vaccines contributed to the reduction of global bacterial diseases and what are the components used in modern vaccines?   Answer: Vaccines have contributed to the reduction of global bacterial diseases by activating macrophages, producing antibodies, and inducing inflammation and other classic immune reactions. Modern vaccines consist of purified components, including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates to protein carriers, as well as inactivated toxins (toxoids) and proteins.   Context: Vaccines rely on immune modulation or augmentation. Vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection, leading to the activation of macrophages, the production of antibodies, inflammation, and other classic immune reactions. Antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases.

Question: What are some of the key architectural features and symbolic elements commonly found in Presbyterian churches?   Answer: Key architectural features commonly found in Presbyterian churches include a communion table, a chancel, a rail between the communion table and the chancel, an altar cross, a baptismal font, and a pulpit. Symbolic elements commonly found in Presbyterian churches include a cross of the resurrection, a Celtic cross, stained glass windows depicting scenes from the Bible, ornate statues of Christ or Graven Scenes from the Last Supper, and an austere decor to not detract from worship.   Context: Usually a Presbyterian church will not have statues of saints, nor the ornate altar more typical of a Roman Catholic church. Instead, one will find a "communion table," usually on the same level as the congregation. There may be a rail between the communion table and the "Chancel" behind it, which may contain a more decorative altar-type table, choir loft, or choir stalls, lectern and clergy area. The altar is called the communion table and the altar area is called the Chancel by Presbyterians. In a Presbyterian (Reformed Church) there may be an altar cross, either on the communion table or on a table in the chancel. By using the "empty" cross, or cross of the resurrection, Presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and that Christ is not continually dying, but died once and is alive for all eternity. Some Presbyterian church buildings are often decorated with a cross that has a circle around the center, or Celtic cross. This not only emphasized the resurrection, but also acknowledges historical aspects of Presbyterianism. A baptismal font will be located either at the entrance or near the chancel area. Presbyterian architecture generally makes significant use of symbolism. You may also find decorative and ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the bible. Some Presbyterian churches will also have ornate statues of Christ or Graven Scenes from the Last Supper located behind the Chancel.

Additionally, they can focus on providing incentives and benefits packages that are tailored to the individual needs of their employees. This could include offering additional training opportunities, career development, and other perks that are not necessarily tied to salary. Finally, they should strive to create a culture of appreciation and recognition for their employees, which can go a long way in creating a positive work environment.

Question: What are the implications of the Quine-Duhem thesis on the process of testing and falsifying scientific hypotheses?   Answer: The Quine-Duhem thesis implies that it is impossible to test a single hypothesis on its own, since each one comes as part of an environment of theories. This means that when testing a hypothesis, it is necessary to consider the entire package of relevant theories and not just the single hypothesis being tested. Furthermore, when a hypothesis is falsified, it is not possible to conclusively say which element of the package must be replaced. Instead, the whole package of relevant theories must be collectively falsified.   Context: The Quine-Duhem thesis argues that it's impossible to test a single hypothesis on its own, since each one comes as part of an environment of theories. Thus we can only say that the whole package of relevant theories has been collectively falsified, but cannot conclusively say which element of the package must be replaced. An example of this is given by the discovery of the planet Neptune: when the motion of Uranus was found not to match the predictions of Newton's laws, the theory "There are seven planets in the solar system" was rejected, and not Newton's laws themselves. Popper discussed this critique of naïve falsificationism in Chapters 3 and 4 of The Logic of Scientific Discovery. For Popper, theories are accepted or rejected via a sort of selection process. Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not; the more generally applicable a theory is, the greater its value. Thus Newton's laws, with their wide general application, are to be preferred over the much more specific "the solar system has seven planets".[dubious – discuss]   Score: 0.879255652 
Question: What are the key principles and methods involved in systematic botany and how do they contribute to our understanding of the range and diversity of organisms?   Answer: Systematic botany is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. The key principles and methods involved in systematic botany include biological classification, scientific taxonomy, and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. This is a form of scientific taxonomy, which is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. Molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy, which includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress. These principles and methods contribute to our understanding of the range and diversity of organisms by providing a systematic way to classify and organize them. This helps us to better understand the evolutionary relationships between different species and how they have changed over time. It also allows us to identify new species and track changes in existing species.   Context: Systematic botany is part of systematic biology, which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.

Question: What were the main political events and organizations involved in Ukraine during the early stages of the dissolution of the Soviet Union?   Answer: The main political events and organizations involved in Ukraine during the early stages of the dissolution of the Soviet Union were the formation of Rukh, the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church's first synod since its liquidation by the Soviets in 1946, the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice officially registering Rukh, the elections of people's deputies to the Supreme Council (Verkhovna Rada), the Lviv City Council voting to return St. George Cathedral to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Ukrainian Helsinki Union disbanding to form the Ukrainian Republican Party, the election of the leader of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU) as parliament chair, and the election of Metropolitan Mstyslav of the U.S.-based Ukrainian Orthodox Church as patriarch of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC).   Context: On January 21, 1990, Rukh organized a 300-mile (480 km) human chain between Kiev, Lviv, and Ivano-Frankivsk. Hundreds of thousands joined hands to commemorate the proclamation of Ukrainian independence in 1918 and the reunification of Ukrainian lands one year later (1919 Unification Act). On January 23, 1990, the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church held its first synod since its liquidation by the Soviets in 1946 (an act which the gathering declared invalid). On February 9, 1990, the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice officially registered Rukh. However, the registration came too late for Rukh to stand its own candidates for the parliamentary and local elections on March 4. At the 1990 elections of people's deputies to the Supreme Council (Verkhovna Rada), candidates from the Democratic Bloc won landslide victories in western Ukrainian oblasts. A majority of the seats had to hold run-off elections. On March 18, Democratic candidates scored further victories in the run-offs. The Democratic Bloc gained about 90 out of 450 seats in the new parliament.   Score: 0.873788536 
Question: What were the reasons behind Pioneer Electronics' decision to enter the optical disc market in 1977 and establish a joint venture with MCA called Universal-Pioneer?   Answer: Pioneer Electronics likely entered the optical disc market in 1977 and established a joint venture with MCA called Universal-Pioneer in order to capitalize on the growing demand for optical disc players and discs. The joint venture allowed Pioneer to manufacture MCA designed industrial players under the MCA DiscoVision name, and to create and market their own LaserDisc players and discs. By creating a joint venture, Pioneer and MCA were able to share resources and expertise, and to create a larger market for their products.   Context: Pioneer Electronics also entered the optical disc market in 1977 as a 50/50 joint-venture with MCA called Universal-Pioneer and manufacturing MCA designed industrial players under the MCA DiscoVision name (the PR-7800 and PR-7820). For the 1980 launch of the first Universal-Pioneer player, the VP-1000 was noted as a "laser disc player", although the "LaserDisc" logo displayed clearly on the device. In 1981, "LaserDisc" was used exclusively for the medium itself, although the official name was "LaserVision" (as seen at the beginning of many LaserDisc releases just before the start of the film). However, as Pioneer reminded numerous video magazines and stores in 1984, LaserDisc was a trademarked word, standing only for LaserVision products manufactured for sale by Pioneer Video or Pioneer Electronics. A 1984 Ray Charles ad for the LD-700 player bore the term "Pioneer LaserDisc brand videodisc player". From 1981 until the early 1990s, all properly licensed discs carried the LaserVision name and logo, even Pioneer Artists titles.   Score: 0.888430238 
Question: How did the Generation of Love and the rise of computers during the Cold War era contribute to societal changes, particularly in terms of social and local mobility?   Answer: The Generation of Love and the rise of computers during the Cold War era contributed to increased social and local mobility by providing people with more opportunities to travel, communicate, and access information. The Generation of Love, which was characterized by a spirit of optimism and a focus on peace and understanding, encouraged people to explore different cultures and ideas. The rise of computers also enabled people to access information more quickly and easily, allowing them to move around more freely and explore new opportunities. This increased access to information and communication allowed people to move around more easily, both locally and internationally, and to access new opportunities.   Context: The Cold War saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm. International crises arose, such as the Berlin Blockade (1948–1949), the Korean War (1950–1953), the Berlin Crisis of 1961, the Vietnam War (1959–1975), the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), the Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979–1989) and NATO exercises in November 1983. There were also periods of reduced tension as both sides sought détente. Direct military attacks on adversaries were deterred by the potential for mutual assured destruction using deliverable nuclear weapons. In the Cold War era, the Generation of Love and the rise of computers changed society in very different, complex ways, including higher social and local mobility.   Score: 0.854388356

Question: What are the key contributions of Principia Mathematica to modern mathematical logic and its connections with logic, epistemology, and metaphysics?   Answer: The key contributions of Principia Mathematica to modern mathematical logic and its connections with logic, epistemology, and metaphysics are its popularization of modern mathematical logic, its demonstration of the impossibility of achieving its own stated goals, and its drawing of important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.   Context: The ultimate substantive legacy of Principia Mathematica is mixed. It is generally accepted that Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them, and hence that Principia Mathematica could never achieve its aims. However, Gödel could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book. In this way, Principia Mathematica's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals. But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy, the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.   Score: 0.88208127

Question: How does stage lighting contribute to the overall atmosphere and impact of a live theatre, dance, or musical performance?   Answer: Stage lighting contributes to the overall atmosphere and impact of a live theatre, dance, or musical performance by creating dramatic effects. Through the use of dimmers, colored filters, reflectors, lenses, motorized or manually aimed lamps, and different kinds of flood and spot lights, a stage lighting designer can create a variety of lighting effects that can help to set the mood and atmosphere of a performance. Additionally, the use of lighting cues allows the lighting operator to control the lights in step with the performance, creating a more immersive experience for the audience.   Context: Lighting illuminates the performers and artists in a live theatre, dance, or musical performance, and is selected and arranged to create dramatic effects. Stage lighting uses general illumination technology in devices configured for easy adjustment of their output characteristics.[citation needed] The setup of stage lighting is tailored for each scene of each production. Dimmers, colored filters, reflectors, lenses, motorized or manually aimed lamps, and different kinds of flood and spot lights are among the tools used by a stage lighting designer to produce the desired effects. A set of lighting cues are prepared so that the lighting operator can control the lights in step with the performance; complex theatre lighting systems use computer control of lighting instruments.

Question: What are some distinguishing features of Islamic architecture and how does it reflect the cultural diversity within Islamic civilization?   Answer: Some distinguishing features of Islamic architecture include ordered repetition, radiating structures, rhythmic, metric patterns, columns, piers and arches, niches and colonnettes, and domes. These features reflect the cultural diversity within Islamic civilization by incorporating elements from different cultures, such as the use of decorative calligraphy instead of pictures which were haram (forbidden) in mosque architecture, and the use of Islamic geometric patterns and foliage based arabesques. Additionally, the use of domes in Islamic architecture has been considerable, spanning centuries and even being incorporated into European architecture in the 19th century.   Context: Encompasses both secular and religious styles, the design and style made by Muslims and their construction of buildings and structures in Islamic culture included the architectural types: the Mosque, the Tomb, the Palace and the Fort. Perhaps the most important expression of Islamic art is architecture, particularly that of the mosque. Through Islamic architecture, effects of varying cultures within Islamic civilization can be illustrated. Generally, the use of Islamic geometric patterns and foliage based arabesques were striking. There was also the use of decorative calligraphy instead of pictures which were haram (forbidden) in mosque architecture.

Question: What factors led to Alexander the Great's decision to retreat from the Indian subcontinent during his conquests?   Answer: Alexander the Great's decision to retreat from the Indian subcontinent during his conquests was largely due to the exhaustion of his army and their fear of facing larger Indian armies at the Ganges River. Additionally, Alexander's meeting with his officer, Coenus, and learning about the might of the Nanda Empire likely played a role in his decision to retreat.   Context: By 326 BC, Alexander the Great had conquered Asia Minor and the Achaemenid Empire and had reached the northwest frontiers of the Indian subcontinent. There he defeated King Porus in the Battle of the Hydaspes (near modern-day Jhelum, Pakistan) and conquered much of the Punjab. Alexander's march east put him in confrontation with the Nanda Empire of Magadha and the Gangaridai of Bengal. His army, exhausted and frightened by the prospect of facing larger Indian armies at the Ganges River, mutinied at the Hyphasis (modern Beas River) and refused to march further East.

Question: What were the factors that contributed to the emergence of Pan-Germanism in the early 19th century?   Answer: The factors that contributed to the emergence of Pan-Germanism in the early 19th century were the Napoleonic Wars, the French Revolution, the rise of nationalism, the division of Central and Eastern European ethnic groups, the Reformation, and the desire of German-speaking people to unite.   Context: Pan-Germanism's origins began in the early 19th century following the Napoleonic Wars. The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the Romanovs and the Habsburgs. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the Reformation when the Holy Roman Empire was shattered into a patchwork of states.

Question: What architectural elements and design principles did Cubist architects incorporate to evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in their buildings?   Answer: Cubist architects incorporated elements such as pyramids, cubes, and prisms, as well as arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called diamond cut, or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late Gothic architecture. They also designed Cubist furniture and used simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass. These elements and design principles were used to create new forms of windows and doors, such as hexagonal windows, and to dissolve and reconstitute three-dimensional form, using simple geometric shapes, juxtaposed without the illusions of classical perspective.   Context: In their theoretical rules, the Cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer. This should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called diamond cut, or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late Gothic architecture. In this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. The grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form. Thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. hexagonal windows. Czech Cubist architects also designed Cubist furniture.   Score: 0.909356833

Question: What are the reasons behind Uzbekistan's continuation and expansion of the program of child labour on an industrial scale?   Answer: The reasons behind Uzbekistan's continuation and expansion of the program of child labour on an industrial scale are likely to be economic. By forcing children to work in the cotton fields, Uzbekistan is able to increase profits on the main source of Islam Karimov's income. This allows the country to generate more revenue and increase their economic growth. Additionally, the use of child labour is often cheaper than hiring adult workers, which further increases profits.   Context: Out of former Soviet Union republics Uzbekistan continued and expanded the program of child labour on industrial scale to increase profits on the main source of Islam Karimov's income, cotton harvesting. In September, when school normally starts, the classes are suspended and children are sent to cotton fields for work, where they are assigned daily quotas of 20 to 60 kg of raw cotton they have to collect.

U Wisara's 166-day hunger strike to protest against a rule that forbade him from wearing his Buddhist robes while imprisoned was also a major factor in the resentment.   Context: Burmese resentment was strong and was vented in violent riots that paralysed Yangon (Rangoon) on occasion all the way until the 1930s. Some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for Burmese culture and traditions such as the British refusal to remove shoes when they entered pagodas.

Question: What were the causes and consequences of the tensions and civil wars that occurred among different Greek factions during the early 19th century?   Answer: The causes of the tensions and civil wars that occurred among different Greek factions during the early 19th century were largely due to the Greek War of Independence, which began in 1821. The Greeks sought to gain independence from the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled the region for centuries. This led to a conflict between the Greeks and the Ottomans, as well as between different Greek factions. The consequences of the tensions and civil wars were significant. The Ottoman Sultan negotiated with Mehmet Ali of Egypt, who agreed to send his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success: by the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control, and the city of Missolonghi—put under siege by the Turks since April 1825—fell in April 1826. Although Ibrahim was defeated in Mani, he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese and Athens had been retaken. This resulted in the Greeks losing their independence and being placed under the rule of the Ottoman Empire once again.

Question: How does the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differ between categories of electric motors or generators?   Answer: The capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators. This is due to the fact that the magnetic core saturation or safe operating temperature rise and voltage limit the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque.   Context: When optimally designed within a given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) within a given air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by magnetic core saturation or safe operating temperature rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.

Question: What were the factors that led to the short-lived existence of the United Arab Republic and its confederation with North Yemen?   Answer: The factors that led to the short-lived existence of the United Arab Republic and its confederation with North Yemen were largely rooted in the unpopularity of Idris' government in the late 1960s. The government had centralized the country's federal system in order to take advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel. Anti-western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. This unrest and dissatisfaction with the government led to the formation of the United Arab Republic and its confederation with North Yemen.   Context: In 1958, Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic. The union was short-lived, ending in 1961 when Syria seceded, thus ending the union. During most of its existence, the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with North Yemen (or the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen), known as the United Arab States. In 1959, the All-Palestine Government of the Gaza Strip, an Egyptian client state, was absorbed into the United Arab Republic under the pretext of Arab union, and was never restored.

Question: What evidence does Baron provide to support the claim that Western great powers consider maintaining a "state of peace" as desirable and have resolved disputes peacefully since the Cuban missile crisis?   Answer: Baron provides evidence that since the Cuban missile crisis, the influential Western nations have resolved all disputes among the great powers peacefully at the United Nations and other forums of international discussion. He also mentions that the two superpowers, the United States and the USSR, narrowly avoided nuclear war and drew conclusions from the Cuban Crisis, leading to a sort of truce in the Cold War. This included the establishment of a direct line between Washington and Moscow and the two Great Powers opening discussions on limiting the arms race.   Context: Another important factor is the apparent consensus among Western great powers that military force is no longer an effective tool of resolving disputes among their peers. This "subset" of great powers – France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – consider maintaining a "state of peace" as desirable. As evidence, Baron outlines that since the Cuban missile crisis (1962) during the Cold War, these influential Western nations have resolved all disputes among the great powers peacefully at the United Nations and other forums of international discussion.

Question: How does the tax system in Puerto Rico contribute to the American Government and what are the implications for Puerto Rican residents?   Answer: The tax system in Puerto Rico contributes to the American Government by requiring residents to pay import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes, and social security taxes. This means that Puerto Rican residents are contributing to the American Government, even though most do not pay federal income tax. The implications for Puerto Rican residents are that they are still able to contribute to the American Government, even if they do not pay federal income tax. Additionally, Puerto Ricans are able to enlist in the U.S. military and have participated in all American wars since 1898. This shows that Puerto Ricans are able to contribute to the American Government in other ways, such as through military service.   Context: Residents of Puerto Rico pay U.S. federal taxes: import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes, social security taxes, therefore contributing to the American Government. Most Puerto Rico residents do not pay federal income tax but do pay federal payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare). However, federal employees, those who do business with the federal government, Puerto Rico–based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S. and others do pay federal income taxes. Puerto Ricans may enlist in the U.S. military.

Question: How did Muammar Gaddafi's invitation to establish General People's Committees contribute to the Popular Revolution in Libya?   Answer: Muammar Gaddafi's invitation to establish General People's Committees was intended to contribute to the Popular Revolution in Libya by providing a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilize the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people.   Context: As part of this Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's people to found General People's Committees as conduits for raising political consciousness.

Question: What are the main organs and processes involved in the digestion of food, and how does the small intestine play a crucial role in nutrient absorption?   Answer: The main organs and processes involved in the digestion of food are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. In the mouth, saliva and digestive enzymes are secreted to form food into a bolus. The bolus is then swallowed into the esophagus and enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. In the stomach, gastric juice containing hydrochloric acid and pepsin is secreted to break down the food further, and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food then enters the small intestine as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice, and intestinal juice. The small intestine is also lined with villi and microvilli, which increase the surface area of the intestine and improve the absorption of nutrients. The partially digested food then enters the large intestine, where water and minerals are absorbed and the remaining waste is eliminated.   Context: Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice.

Question: What were the limitations and shortcomings of British night air defences during the Blitz, and how did this impact their effectiveness in countering German bombers?   Answer: The British night air defences during the Blitz were limited and had several shortcomings. The anti-aircraft guns had fire-control systems, and the searchlights were usually ineffective against aircraft at altitudes above 12,000 ft (3,700 m). Additionally, the anti-aircraft guns had a theoretical "ceiling"' of over 30,000 ft (9,100 m) but a practical limit of 25,000 ft (7,600 m) because the predictor in use could not accept greater heights. The light guns, about half of which were of the excellent Bofors 40 mm, dealt with aircraft only up to 6,000 ft (1,800 m). This lack of effective anti-aircraft defences meant that the British were unable to effectively counter the German bombers, and the falling shell fragments caused more British casualties on the ground.   Context: London's defences were rapidly reorganised by General Pile, the Commander-in-Chief of Anti-Aircraft Command. The difference this made to the effectiveness of air defences is questionable. The British were still one-third below the establishment of heavy anti-aircraft artillery AAA (or ack-ack) in May 1941, with only 2,631 weapons available. Dowding had to rely on night fighters. From 1940 to 1941, the most successful night-fighter was the Boulton Paul Defiant; its four squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type. AA defences improved by better use of radar and searchlights. Over several months, the 20,000 shells spent per raider shot down in September 1940, was reduced to 4,087 in January 1941 and to 2,963 shells in February 1941.   Score: 0.884386957 
Question: What were the initial challenges faced by Alexander Fleming in the development of penicillin as a chemotherapy agent?   Answer: The initial challenges faced by Alexander Fleming in the development of penicillin as a chemotherapy agent were the lack of trained chemists to help him further develop the compound, and the difficulty of using a crude preparation to treat infections.   Context: The effects of some types of mold on infection had been noticed many times over the course of history (see: History of penicillin). In 1928, Alexander Fleming noticed the same effect in a Petri dish, where a number of disease-causing bacteria were killed by a fungus of the genus Penicillium. Fleming postulated that the effect is mediated by an antibacterial compound he named penicillin, and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterized some of its biological properties, and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections, but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists.

Question: What is the significance of the alpine ibex and chamois in the ecosystem of the Alps?   Answer: The alpine ibex and chamois are important to the ecosystem of the Alps because they are the largest mammals to live in the highest altitudes, and they help to maintain the balance of the alpine environment by grazing on the succulent alpine grasses. They also provide food for other predators, such as the brown bear, which is still found in some areas of the eastern Alps.   Context: The largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the alpine ibex, which have been sighted as high as 3,000 m (9,843 ft). The ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses. Classified as antelopes, chamois are smaller than ibex and found throughout the Alps, living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range.

Question: What are some similarities and differences between Carnival and other Christian festivals in terms of their origins and adaptation by the Christian church?   Answer: Similarities: Both Carnival and other Christian festivals have been adapted by the Christian church from their pagan origins. Differences: Carnival was likely established under Venetian rule around the 16th century, while other Christian festivals may have been influenced by Greek traditions. Carnival is celebrated almost exclusively in the city of Limassol, while other Christian festivals are celebrated more widely. Carnival is celebrated for 10 days preceding Lent, while other Christian festivals may have different lengths of celebration.   Context: While christian festivals such as corpus christi were church-sanctioned celebrations, Carnival was also a manifestation of European folk culture. In the Christian tradition the fasting is to commemorate the 40 days that Jesus fasted in the desert according to the New Testament and also to reflect on Christian values. As with many other Christian festivals such as Christmas which was originally a pagan midwinter festival, the Christian church has found it easier to turn the pagan Carnaval in a catholic tradition than to eliminate it.  Unlike today, carnival in the Middle Ages took not just a few days, but it covered almost the entire period between Christmas and the beginning of Lent. In those two months, several Catholic holidays were seized by the Catholic population as an outlet for their daily frustrations.   Score: 0.887199104

Question: What strategies did Kuribayashi employ to transform the island into a formidable defensive network during the Pacific War?   Answer: Kuribayashi employed a number of strategies to transform the island into a formidable defensive network during the Pacific War. He constructed a massive network of bunkers, hidden guns, and 11 mi (18 km) of underground tunnels.

Additionally, he employed heavy antiaircraft defenses and used the island's terrain to his advantage. Finally, he used the island's natural resources to create obstacles and barriers to slow down the enemy's advance.   Context: From early 1944 until the days leading up to the invasion, Kuribayashi transformed the island into a massive network of bunkers, hidden guns, and 11 mi (18 km) of underground tunnels.

Question: What are some industries that benefit from the use of zinc alloys in die casting and spin casting processes?   Answer: The automotive, electrical, and hardware industries all benefit from the use of zinc alloys in die casting and spin casting processes. These alloys are used to create intricate shapes and allow for rapid cooling and fast assembly.   Context: Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An example of this is zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes the production of small and intricate shapes possible. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and therefore fast assembly is possible. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.   Score: 0.890708327 
Question: What are some examples of Gothic architecture that appeared in the late 17th century, and how do historians differentiate between Gothic survival and early appearances of Gothic revival in these instances?   Answer: Examples of Gothic architecture that appeared in the late 17th century include the Gothic hammerbeam roof at Lambeth Palace, and the discrete Gothic details on new construction at Oxford University and Cambridge University, notably on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, by Christopher Wren.  Historians differentiate between Gothic survival and early appearances of Gothic revival in these instances by looking at the context of the architecture, such as the materials used, the design, and the purpose of the building. For example, if the building was constructed with traditional Gothic materials and design, it is likely to be a Gothic survival. However, if the building was constructed with modern materials and design, it is likely to be an early appearance of Gothic revival.   Context: In 1663 at the Archbishop of Canterbury's residence, Lambeth Palace, a Gothic hammerbeam roof was built to replace that destroyed when the building was sacked during the English Civil War. Also in the late 17th century, some discrete Gothic details appeared on new construction at Oxford University and Cambridge University, notably on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, by Christopher Wren.

Question: How did the decline of India's cotton supply and the emergence of American cotton contribute to the economic transformation of the southern United States in the mid-19th century?   Answer: The decline of India's cotton supply and the emergence of American cotton contributed to the economic transformation of the southern United States in the mid-19th century by making cotton a much more profitable crop. The longer, stronger fibers of the two domesticated native American species, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense, made American cotton a superior type to the cotton from India. This, coupled with the invention of the cotton gin, which made it much easier to clean the seeds from the cotton, made it much more profitable to use slave labor to grow cotton. This led to the emergence of "King Cotton" as the backbone of the southern American economy.   Context: By the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories, while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was time-consuming and expensive. This, coupled with the emergence of American cotton as a superior type (due to the longer, stronger fibers of the two domesticated native American species, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense), encouraged British traders to purchase cotton from plantations in the United States and plantations in the Caribbean. By the mid-19th century, "King Cotton" had become the backbone of the southern American economy. In the United States, cultivating and harvesting cotton became the leading occupation of slaves.

Additionally, the Islamic scholarly system of fatwá and ijmāʻ formed the basis of the "scholarly system the West has practised in university scholarship from the Middle Ages down to the present day."   Context: Nevertheless, Makdisi has asserted that the European university borrowed many of its features from the Islamic madrasa, including the concepts of a degree and doctorate. Makdisi and Hugh Goddard have also highlighted other terms and concepts now used in modern universities which most likely have Islamic origins, including "the fact that we still talk of professors holding the 'Chair' of their subject" being based on the "traditional Islamic pattern of teaching where the professor sits on a chair and the students sit around him", the term 'academic circles' being derived from the way in which Islamic students "sat in a circle around their professor", and terms such as "having 'fellows', 'reading' a subject, and obtaining 'degrees', can all be traced back" to the Islamic concepts of aṣḥāb ('companions, as of Muhammad'), qirāʼah ('reading aloud the Qur'an') and ijāzah ('licence [to teach]') respectively. Makdisi has listed eighteen such parallels in terminology which can be traced back to their roots in Islamic education. Some of the practices now common in modern universities which Makdisi and Goddard trace back to an Islamic root include "practices such as delivering inaugural lectures, wearing academic robes, obtaining doctorates by defending a thesis, and even the idea of academic freedom are also modelled on Islamic custom." The Islamic scholarly system of fatwá and ijmāʻ, meaning opinion and consensus respectively, formed the basis of the "scholarly system the West has practised in university scholarship from the Middle Ages down to the present day." According to Makdisi and Goddard, "the idea of academic freedom" in universities was also "modelled on Islamic custom" as practised in the medieval Madrasa system from the 9th century.

Question: What were the reasons behind the failed deals with Sony and Philips to develop a CD-ROM-based peripheral for the SNES, and how did these failures impact the future of both companies in the gaming industry?   Answer: The reasons behind the failed deals with Sony and Philips to develop a CD-ROM-based peripheral for the SNES are not explicitly stated in the context information. However, it is likely that the deals failed due to disagreements between the companies over the terms of the agreement, or due to the companies not being able to come to an agreement at all. The failure of the deals had a significant impact on the future of both companies in the gaming industry. Philips gained the right to release a series of titles based on Nintendo franchises for its CD-i multimedia player, while Sony went on to develop its own console based on its initial dealings with Nintendo (the PlayStation). This allowed both companies to gain a foothold in the gaming industry, and both have since become major players in the industry.   Context: During the SNES's life, Nintendo contracted with two different companies to develop a CD-ROM-based peripheral for the console to compete with Sega's CD-ROM based addon, Mega-CD. Ultimately, deals with both Sony and Philips fell through, (although a prototype console was produced by Sony) with Philips gaining the right to release a series of titles based on Nintendo franchises for its CD-i multimedia player and Sony going on to develop its own console based on its initial dealings with Nintendo (the PlayStation).

Question: What is the significance of Brigham Young University being owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and having a majority of its students being members of the LDS Church?   Answer: The significance of Brigham Young University being owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and having a majority of its students being members of the LDS Church is that it creates an environment that is strongly influenced by the teachings and values of the LDS Church. This influences the school's mission, which is to be an "ambassador" to the world for the LDS Church and thus, for Jesus Christ. It also encourages students and faculty to follow the teachings of their religion, adhere to the school's honor code, and serve others with the knowledge they gain while attending.   Context: Brigham Young University (often referred to as BYU or, colloquially, The Y) is a private research university located in Provo, Utah, United States. It is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and, excluding online students, is the largest of any religious university and the third largest private university in the United States, with 29,672 on-campus students. Approximately 99 percent of the students are members of the LDS Church, and one-third of its US students are from Utah.   Score: 0.894022942 
Question: What is the role of the Governing Body in the hierarchical organization of Jehovah's Witnesses and how do they select new members?   Answer: The Governing Body is the highest authority in the hierarchical organization of Jehovah's Witnesses and is responsible for interpreting and applying scripture. They are the representatives and "spokesman" for God's "faithful and discreet slave class" and provide "divine guidance" through their teachings. New members are selected by the existing Governing Body and there is no election for membership.   Context: Jehovah's Witnesses are organized hierarchically, in what the leadership calls a "theocratic organization", reflecting their belief that it is God's "visible organization" on earth. The organization is led by the Governing Body—an all-male group that varies in size, but since early 2014 has comprised seven members,[note 1] all of whom profess to be of the "anointed" class with a hope of heavenly life—based in the Watch Tower Society's Brooklyn headquarters. There is no election for membership; new members are selected by the existing body. Until late 2012, the Governing Body described itself as the representative and "spokesman" for God's "faithful and discreet slave class" (approximately 10,000 self-professed "anointed" Jehovah's Witnesses). At the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Society, the "faithful and discreet slave" was defined as referring to the Governing Body only. The Governing Body directs several committees that are responsible for administrative functions, including publishing, assembly programs and evangelizing activities. It appoints all branch committee members and traveling overseers, after they have been recommended by local branches, with traveling overseers supervising circuits of congregations within their jurisdictions. Traveling overseers appoint local elders and ministerial servants, and while branch offices may appoint regional committees for matters such as Kingdom Hall construction or disaster relief.

Question: What are the implications of the Norwegian researchers' findings on circadian rhythms in Arctic animals and how might this knowledge be applicable to other Arctic species?   Answer: The Norwegian researchers' findings suggest that Arctic animals may not show circadian rhythms in the constant light of summer and the constant dark of winter. This knowledge could be applicable to other Arctic species by providing insight into how they may respond to extreme environmental conditions. For example, understanding how animals adapt to the lack of light and darkness could help researchers develop strategies to help species survive in extreme conditions. Additionally, this knowledge could be used to inform conservation efforts in the Arctic, as well as to better understand the effects of climate change on Arctic species.   Context: Norwegian researchers at the University of Tromsø have shown that some Arctic animals (ptarmigan, reindeer) show circadian rhythms only in the parts of the year that have daily sunrises and sunsets. In one study of reindeer, animals at 70 degrees North showed circadian rhythms in the autumn, winter and spring, but not in the summer. Reindeer on Svalbard at 78 degrees North showed such rhythms only in autumn and spring. The researchers suspect that other Arctic animals as well may not show circadian rhythms in the constant light of summer and the constant dark of winter.   Score: 0.913188338

Question: What were the major developments and expansions of Northwestern University's Chicago campus in the early 20th century, and how did they contribute to the university's growth and reputation?   Answer: In the early 20th century, Northwestern University's Chicago campus underwent major developments and expansions that contributed to the university's growth and reputation. In 1917, a master plan was created for a central Chicago campus, and 8.5 acres of land were purchased at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive for $1.5 million in 1920. The architect James Gamble Rogers was commissioned to create a master plan for the principal buildings on the new campus, which he designed in collegiate gothic style. In 1923, Mrs. Montgomery Ward donated $8 million to the campaign to finance the construction of the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building, which would house the medical and dental schools and create endowments for faculty chairs, research grants, scholarships, and building maintenance. This building would become the first university skyscraper in the United States. In addition to the Ward Building, Rogers designed Wieboldt Hall to house facilities for the School of Commerce and Levy Mayer Hall to house the School of Law. The new campus comprising these three new buildings was dedicated during a two-day ceremony in June 1927. The Chicago campus continued to expand with the addition of Thorne Hall in 1931 and Abbott Hall in 1939. These expansions and developments helped to solidify Northwestern University's reputation as a leading research university and helped to attract more students and faculty to the university.   Context: Like other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by World War II. Franklyn B. Snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949, when nearly 50,000 military officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston and Chicago campuses. After the war, surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove drastic expansion of both campuses. In 1948 prominent anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits founded the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution. J. Roscoe Miller's tenure as president from 1949 to 1970 was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston campus, with the construction of the lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. In 1978, the first and second Unabomber attacks occurred at Northwestern University. Relations between Evanston and Northwestern were strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism, disputes over municipal zoning, building codes, and law enforcement, as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus until 1972. Northwestern's exemption from state and municipal property tax obligations under its original charter has historically been a source of town and gown tension.   Score: 0.885153234 
Question: What factors contribute to the absence of true exhibition games between opposing colleges at the highest level of college football?   Answer: The factors that contribute to the absence of true exhibition games between opposing colleges at the highest level of college football are the importance of opinion polling and the potential for the games to influence the opinions of those polled. Additionally, teams at levels below the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) have championships that are decided by objective formulas, so playing non-league games would not affect their playoff hopes.   Context: True exhibition games between opposing colleges at the highest level do not exist in college football; due to the importance of opinion polling in the top level of college football, even exhibition games would not truly be exhibitions because they could influence the opinions of those polled. Intramural games are possible because a team playing against itself leaves little ability for poll participants to make judgments, and at levels below the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), championships are decided by objective formulas and thus those teams can play non-league games without affecting their playoff hopes.

Question: What were the reasons behind the establishment of the Royal College of Chemistry in 1845, and who were some of the notable individuals who supported its creation?   Answer: The Royal College of Chemistry was established by private subscription in 1845 due to a growing awareness that practical aspects of the experimental sciences were not being taught well in the United Kingdom, and that the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that of Germany. Notable individuals who supported its creation included Benjamin Disraeli, William Gladstone, Robert Peel, and Prince Albert, who persuaded August Wilhelm von Hofmann to be the first professor.   Context: The Royal College of Chemistry was established by private subscription in 1845 as there was a growing awareness that practical aspects of the experimental sciences were not well taught and that in the United Kingdom the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that in Germany.

Question: What are the advantages of using 720p format for Internet distribution of high-definition video compared to 1080i and 1080p formats?   Answer: The advantages of using 720p format for Internet distribution of high-definition video compared to 1080i and 1080p formats are that it requires less strenuous storage and decoding requirements, and it is compatible with most computer monitors which operate in progressive-scan mode.   Context: Non-cinematic HDTV video recordings intended for broadcast are typically recorded either in 720p or 1080i format as determined by the broadcaster. 720p is commonly used for Internet distribution of high-definition video, because most computer monitors operate in progressive-scan mode. 720p also imposes less strenuous storage and decoding requirements compared to both 1080i and 1080p. 1080p/24, 1080i/30, 1080i/25, and 720p/30 is most often used on Blu-ray Disc.

In 2003, The Sun was accused of racism by the Government over its criticisms of immigration. 2. In 2003, The Sun published a front page story claiming that asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans, which later proved to have no basis in fact. 3. In 2005, The Sun published photographs of Prince Harry sporting a Nazi costume to a fancy dress party, causing outrage across the world. 4. The Sun's editorials were often critical of Prime Minister Gordon Brown's policies and more supportive of those of Conservative leader David Cameron. 5. Rupert Murdoch, head of The Sun's parent company News Corporation, exercises editorial control on major issues such as which political party to back in a general election or which policy to adopt on Europe.   Context: In 2003 the paper was accused of racism by the Government over its criticisms of what it perceived as the "open door" policy on immigration. The attacks came from the Prime Minister's press spokesman Alastair Campbell and the Home Secretary David Blunkett (later a Sun columnist). The paper rebutted the claim, believing that it was not racist to suggest that a "tide" of unchecked illegal immigrants was increasing the risk of terrorist attacks and infectious diseases. It did not help its argument by publishing a front page story on 4 July 2003, under the headline "Swan Bake", which claimed that asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans. It later proved to have no basis in fact. Subsequently The Sun published a follow-up headlined "Now they're after our fish!".

Question: What factors have contributed to Rajasthan's significant increase in revenue from the crude oil sector, and how does this impact the overall production of crude oil in India?   Answer: The factors that have contributed to Rajasthan's significant increase in revenue from the crude oil sector are the permission given by the government of India to extract 300,000 barrels of crude per day from the Barmer region, and the work of exploration and extraction of crude oil by Cairn India. This increase in production has the potential to increase the overall production of crude oil in India by 15 percent, as Rajasthan will become a leader in crude extraction in the country. Bombay High currently leads with a production of 250,000 barrels of crude per day, and if the limit of 300,000 barrels per day is reached, the overall production of the country will increase significantly.   Context: Rajasthan is[when?] earning Rs. 150 million (approx. US$2.5 million) per day as revenue from the crude oil sector.

Question: What is the significance of Steven Spielberg's tendency to work with actors and production members from his previous films?   Answer: The significance of Steven Spielberg's tendency to work with actors and production members from his previous films is that it demonstrates his loyalty to those who have worked with him in the past. It also shows that he is comfortable working with people he knows and trusts, which can help create a more cohesive and successful production.   Context: In terms of casting and production itself, Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films. For instance, he has cast Richard Dreyfuss in several films: Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Always. Aside from his role as Indiana Jones, Spielberg also cast Harrison Ford as a headteacher in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (though the scene was ultimately cut). Although Spielberg directed veteran voice actor Frank Welker only once (in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for which he voiced many of the animals), Welker has lent his voice in a number of productions Spielberg has executive produced from Gremlins to its sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch, as well as The Land Before Time, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and television shows such as Tiny Toons, Animaniacs, and SeaQuest DSV.

Answer: The main theological and philosophical developments during the Later Middle Ages that challenged the prevailing ideas of scholasticism and allowed for the separation of science from theology and philosophy were led by theologians such as John Duns Scotus and William of Ockham. These theologians objected to the application of reason to faith, which undermined the Platonic idea of "universals". Ockham's insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy.   Context: During the Later Middle Ages, theologians such as John Duns Scotus (d. 1308)[AH] and William of Ockham (d. c. 1348), led a reaction against scholasticism, objecting to the application of reason to faith. Their efforts undermined the prevailing Platonic idea of "universals". Ockham's insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy. Legal studies were marked by the steady advance of Roman law into areas of jurisprudence previously governed by customary law.

Context: In the 1960s, the term bandes dessinées ("drawn strips") came into wide use in French to denote the medium. Cartoonists began creating comics for mature audiences, and the term "Ninth Art"[e] was coined, as comics began to attract public and academic attention as an artform. A group including René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo founded the magazine Pilote in 1959 to give artists greater freedom over their work. Goscinny and Uderzo's The Adventures of Asterix appeared in it and went on to become the best-selling French-language comics series.

Question: What are the key principles of natural phonology and how were they extended to morphology by Wolfgang U. Dressler?   Answer: The key principles of natural phonology are that phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another, and that phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups. Wolfgang U. Dressler extended these principles to morphology by founding natural morphology, which applies the same principles of natural phonology to the study of the structure of words.   Context: Natural phonology is a theory based on the publications of its proponent David Stampe in 1969 and (more explicitly) in 1979. In this view, phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another; which ones are active and which are suppressed is language-specific. Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance. Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously (though the output of one process may be the input to another). The second most prominent natural phonologist is Patricia Donegan (Stampe's wife); there are many natural phonologists in Europe, and a few in the U.S., such as Geoffrey Nathan. The principles of natural phonology were extended to morphology by Wolfgang U. Dressler, who founded natural morphology.   Score: 0.859754622 
Question: What factors contributed to the migration of Catalan speakers to Algeria and their subsequent relocation to Northern Catalonia and Alacant?   Answer: The main factor that contributed to the migration of Catalan speakers to Algeria was the French capture of Algeria in 1833. This led to several waves of Catalan-speaking settlers from the Spanish Alacant province settling around Oran, and from Northern Catalonia and Minorca settling in Algiers. The Catalan rulers' expansion up to north of the Ebro river in the 11th and 12th centuries, and their subsequent conquest of the Land of Valencia and the Balearic Islands in the 13th century, also contributed to the migration of Catalan speakers to Algeria. The repopulation of the city of Alghero in Sardinia with Catalan speakers in the 14th century also contributed to the migration. The subsequent relocation of Catalan speakers from Algeria to Northern Catalonia and Alacant was due to the declaration of independence of Algeria in 1962, which caused almost all the Catalan speakers to flee.   Context: Following the French capture of Algeria (1833), that region saw several waves of Catalan-speaking settlers. People from the Spanish Alacant province settled around Oran, whereas Algiers received immigration from Northern Catalonia and Minorca. Their speech was known as patuet. By 1911, the number of Catalan speakers was around 100,000.

Question: What were the reasons behind Dwight D. Eisenhower's decision to force an end to the combined British, French, and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis in 1956?   Answer: Dwight D. Eisenhower's decision to force an end to the combined British, French, and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis in 1956 was motivated by his desire to protect the sovereignty of Egypt and to uphold the principles of the United Nations. He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt. Eisenhower also condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, further demonstrating his commitment to upholding international law and order.   Context: In November 1956, Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British, French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis, receiving praise from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

Question: What were some significant actions taken by the New York Manumission Society to promote abolition and education for black children in New York City?   Answer: The New York Manumission Society took several significant actions to promote abolition and education for black children in New York City. These included working for abolition, establishing the African Free School to educate black children, and providing support for interracial abolitionist activism. The African Free School was founded to provide education to black children, and the New York Manumission Society provided support for interracial abolitionist activism, which was led by graduates of the African Free School.   Context: Under New York State's gradual abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were born to be eventually liberated but were held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties. Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential United States founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate black children. It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School. The city's black population reached more than 16,000 in 1840.   Score: 0.906009614 
Question: What is the significance of the diverse distribution of religions and people in Southeast Asia and how does it vary by country?   Answer: The diverse distribution of religions and people in Southeast Asia reflects the region's long history of cultural exchange and interaction. This diversity is evident in the different religious practices found in each country, from Islam in Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia and the Southern Philippines, to Buddhism in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Vietnam and Singapore, to Christianity in the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, East Malaysia and East Timor. This diversity is also reflected in the different forms of ancestor worship and Confucianism found in Vietnam and Singapore, and the unique form of Balinese Hinduism found in Indonesia. This diversity of religions and peoples has allowed for a rich cultural exchange and interaction between countries in the region, and has helped to shape the unique identities of each country.   Context: Religions and peoples are diverse in Southeast Asia and not one country is homogeneous. In the world's most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia, Hinduism is dominant on islands such as Bali. Christianity also predominates in the rest of the part of the Philippines, New Guinea and Timor. Pockets of Hindu population can also be found around Southeast Asia in Singapore, Malaysia etc. Garuda (Sanskrit: Garuḍa), the phoenix who is the mount (vahanam) of Vishnu, is a national symbol in both Thailand and Indonesia; in the Philippines, gold images of Garuda have been found on Palawan; gold images of other Hindu gods and goddesses have also been found on Mindanao. Balinese Hinduism is somewhat different from Hinduism practised elsewhere, as Animism and local culture is incorporated into it. Christians can also be found throughout Southeast Asia; they are in the majority in East Timor and the Philippines, Asia's largest Christian nation. In addition, there are also older tribal religious practices in remote areas of Sarawak in East Malaysia,Highland Philippines and Papua in eastern Indonesia.

Question: How can plant responses to climate and other environmental changes contribute to our understanding of ecosystem function and productivity?   Answer: Plant responses to climate and other environmental changes can provide valuable insight into how these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity. For example, plant phenology can be used to reconstruct past climates, and estimates of atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the Palaeozoic can be obtained from stomatal densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants. Ozone depletion can also lead to lower growth rates due to increased exposure to UV-B radiation. Additionally, information from studies of community ecology, plant systematics, and taxonomy can help us to understand vegetation change, habitat destruction, and species extinction. All of this information can be used to better understand the impacts of climate and environmental changes on ecosystem function and productivity.   Context: Plant responses to climate and other environmental changes can inform our understanding of how these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity. For example, plant phenology can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical climatology, and the biological impact of climate change and global warming. Palynology, the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from thousands or millions of years ago allows the reconstruction of past climates. Estimates of atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the Palaeozoic have been obtained from stomatal densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants.

Question: What is the process called when a P-N junction emits light when electrical energy is applied to it?   Answer: The process when a P-N junction emits light when electrical energy is applied to it is called electroluminescence.   Context: A P-N junction can convert absorbed light energy into a proportional electric current. The same process is reversed here (i.e. the P-N junction emits light when electrical energy is applied to it). This phenomenon is generally called electroluminescence, which can be defined as the emission of light from a semi-conductor under the influence of an electric field. The charge carriers recombine in a forward-biased P-N junction as the electrons cross from the N-region and recombine with the holes existing in the P-region. Free electrons are in the conduction band of energy levels, while holes are in the valence energy band. Thus the energy level of the holes will be lesser than the energy levels of the electrons. Some portion of the energy must be dissipated in order to recombine the electrons and the holes. This energy is emitted in the form of heat and light.   Score: 0.924735546 
Question: How does the closure of local newspapers affect political corruption and the engagement of politicians with their constituents?   Answer: The closure of local newspapers can lead to increased political corruption and decreased engagement of politicians with their constituents. Without the press coverage, politicians are less likely to stand witness before congressional hearings and are more likely to win reelection. This can lead to decreased federal spending in the area and fewer candidates running for municipal office. This can lead to a lack of accountability and transparency, which can create an environment where political corruption can thrive.   Context: Snyder and Strömberg found "that a poor fit between newspaper markets and political districts reduces press coverage of politics. ... Congressmen who are less covered by the local press work less for their constituencies: they are less likely to stand witness before congressional hearings ... . Federal spending is lower in areas where there is less press coverage of the local members of congress."

Answer: Significant examples of countries outside of the United States that have adopted the rule of strict liability for defective products include the European Economic Community, Australia, and Japan.   Context: Notably, the most broadly influential innovation of 20th-century American tort law was the rule of strict liability for defective products, which originated with judicial glosses on the law of warranty. In 1963, Roger J. Traynor of the Supreme Court of California threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the landmark case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Products. The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States.

Question: How did Alexander Pushkin revolutionize Russian literature and contribute to the development of the modern literary language?   Answer: Alexander Pushkin revolutionized Russian literature by rejecting the archaic grammar and vocabulary of the "high style" in favor of the grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. This allowed for a more accessible and relatable form of literature, which was more easily understood by readers. This shift in language also opened the door for the adoption of specialized vocabulary from Western European languages, further contributing to the development of the modern literary language.   Context: The modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of Alexander Pushkin (Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин) in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized Russian literature by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called "высо́кий стиль" — "high style") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov (Михаи́л Ле́рмонтов), Nikolai Gogol (Никола́й Го́голь), Aleksander Griboyedov (Алекса́ндр Грибое́дов), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.

Question: What factors contributed to the popularity of clandestine booksellers during the Age of Enlightenment in France, and how did their offerings differ from those approved by French censors?   Answer: The popularity of clandestine booksellers during the Age of Enlightenment in France was largely due to the strict censorship laws imposed by the French government. These laws made it difficult for booksellers and publishers to legally distribute their works, so many resorted to smuggling their merchandise across the border and selling it to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers. The clandestine nature of these booksellers allowed them to provide a less restrictive product choice than what was approved by French censors. The most popular category of books sold by clandestine booksellers were political books, primarily libels and pamphlets, which were more interesting to readers than political theory. The second most popular category was "general works" which contained something to offend almost everyone in authority. These works never became part of the literary canon and are largely forgotten today.   Context: Across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. The Encyclopédie, for example, narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by Malesherbes, the man in charge of the French censure. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers. The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice. In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, "general works" (those books "that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority") demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature. However, these works never became part of literary canon, and are largely forgotten today as a result.   Score: 0.914139688 
Question: What were the implications and consequences of the Eisenhower Administration's decision to release a cover story about the U-2 spy-plane incident?   Answer: The Eisenhower Administration's decision to release a cover story about the U-2 spy-plane incident had several implications and consequences. The cover story was intended to protect the United States from international criticism and to prevent the Soviets from learning the true purpose of the mission. However, the Soviets were able to uncover the truth and put the pilot, Captain Powers, on trial. This incident caused a great deal of embarrassment for the United States and strained relations between the two countries. Additionally, the incident led to increased surveillance of the Soviet Union by the Eisenhower Administration, as well as the deployment of thirty Lockheed U-2's at a cost of $35 million.   Context: Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a "spy-plane" had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot. As a result, the Eisenhower Administration, thinking the pilot had died in the crash, authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a "weather research aircraft" which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed "difficulties with his oxygen equipment" while flying over Turkey.

Question: What evidence is there to support the claim that medieval European developments in university life were independent of Islamic influence, as suggested by standard scholarship?   Answer: Standard scholarship suggests that medieval European developments in university life were independent of Islamic influence due to the lack of evidence of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world. Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation, the taliqa, was reserved for the ruler's court, not the madrasa, and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound. There is no Latin translation of the taliqa and, most importantly, no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation. Rather, it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion. Hugh Kennedy also shares the view that Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence, not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other.   Context: Many scholars (including Makdisi) have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the religious madrasahs in Al-Andalus, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Middle East (during the Crusades). Other scholars see this argument as overstated. Lowe and Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education, turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context.

Question: What were the circumstances that led to an extraordinary sacrifice in ancient Rome during the Second Punic War?   Answer: The extraordinary circumstances that led to an extraordinary sacrifice in ancient Rome during the Second Punic War were the shortage of manpower and the huge losses incurred during various wars. This caused a decline in population and severe social stresses, leading the Roman state to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state. As a result, in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring as a sacrifice.   Context: The extraordinary demands of the Punic Wars, in addition to a shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at least in the short term. In 217 BC, near the beginning of the Second Punic War, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century BC, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population, partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars.

Question: What were the different social divisions in Qing society and how did they affect the rights and treatment of different groups of people?   Answer: In Qing society, there were five main social divisions: officials, aristocracy, degree-holding literati, commoners, and people with inferior status. Commoners were considered to have a higher status than those with inferior status, and were legally allowed to take the imperial examination. Those with inferior status, such as slaves, bondservants, entertainers, and low-level employees of government officials, were considered legally inferior to commoners and suffered unequal treatments, such as being forbidden to take the imperial examination.   Context: According to statute, Qing society was divided into relatively closed estates, of which in most general terms there were five. Apart from the estates of the officials, the comparatively minuscule aristocracy, and the degree-holding literati, there also existed a major division among ordinary Chinese between commoners and people with inferior status. They were divided into two categories: one of them, the good "commoner" people, the other "mean" people. The majority of the population belonged to the first category and were described as liangmin, a legal term meaning good people, as opposed to jianmin meaning the mean (or ignoble) people. Qing law explicitly stated that the traditional four occupational groups of scholars, farmers, artisans and merchants were "good", or having a status of commoners.

In return for staging these attacks, Spectre is given unlimited access to the intelligence gathered by the Nine Eyes program. This access to intelligence is what Ernst Stavro Blofeld is after, as it allows him to further his own agenda. Blofeld's motivations stem from his belief that Bond supplanted his role as son, and so he killed his father and adopted the name Ernst Stavro Blofeld in order to form Spectre. The Nine Eyes program is a key part of Blofeld's plan, as it gives him access to the intelligence he needs to further his agenda.   Context: The two travel to the hotel and discover White's secret room where they find co-ordinates pointing to Oberhauser's operations base in the desert. They travel by train to the nearest station, but are once again confronted by Hinx; they engage in a fight throughout the train in which Mr Hinx is eventually thrown off the train by Bond with Swann's assistance. After arriving at the station, Bond and Swann are escorted to Oberhauser's base. There, he reveals that Spectre has been staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return Spectre will be given unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father, Hannes, became his temporary guardian. Believing that Bond supplanted his role as son, Oberhauser killed his father and staged his own death, subsequently adopting the name Ernst Stavro Blofeld and going on to form Spectre. Bond and Swann escape, destroying the base in the process, leaving Blofeld to apparently die during the explosion.   Score: 0.864561796 
Question: What factors contributed to the significant participation and success of women in prize competitions during the Age of Enlightenment, despite the lack of academic training for most women at that time?   Answer: The enforced anonymity of each submission and the open nature of the competitions likely contributed to the significant participation and success of women in prize competitions during the Age of Enlightenment. This anonymity allowed women to compete without the social and gender biases that would have otherwise been present. Additionally, the majority of the winning entries were for poetry competitions, a genre commonly stressed in women's education, which likely gave women an advantage in the competitions.   Context: More importantly, the contests were open to all, and the enforced anonymity of each submission guaranteed that neither gender nor social rank would determine the judging. Indeed, although the "vast majority" of participants belonged to the wealthier strata of society ("the liberal arts, the clergy, the judiciary, and the medical profession"), there were some cases of the popular classes submitting essays, and even winning. Similarly, a significant number of women participated – and won – the competitions. Of a total of 2300 prize competitions offered in France, women won 49 – perhaps a small number by modern standards, but very significant in an age in which most women did not have any academic training. Indeed, the majority of the winning entries were for poetry competitions, a genre commonly stressed in women's education.   Score: 0.901985884 
Question: What are the various circumstances in Canadian football that result in play being stopped?   Answer: The various circumstances in Canadian football that result in play being stopped are: when the ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands is forced to the ground (a tackle); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during a scrimmage); when a touchdown or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress). Additionally, during the last three minutes of a half, repeated deliberate time count violations on third down can result in the referee giving possession to the defence.   Context: Play stops when the ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a tackle); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during a scrimmage); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress).

Question: What are some key practices and teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses regarding spreading their beliefs and engaging in public preaching?   Answer: Jehovah's Witnesses are instructed to spread their beliefs by visiting people from house to house and distributing literature published by the Watch Tower Society in 700 languages. They are also taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching and are required to submit an individual monthly "Field Service Report". Baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed "irregular" and may be counseled by elders. Witnesses are discouraged from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body, and those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as "apostates".   Context: Jehovah's Witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs, most notably by visiting people from house to house, distributing literature published by the Watch Tower Society in 700 languages. The objective is to start a regular "Bible study" with any person who is not already a member, with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members. Witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching. They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly "Field Service Report".

Question: What evidence suggests that there was a coexistence between the Akkadian and Sumerian languages for a significant period of time?   Answer: The evidence that suggests that there was a coexistence between the Akkadian and Sumerian languages for a significant period of time is that texts written entirely in Old Akkadian date back to c. 2500 BC, and that Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for about one thousand years. Additionally, Thorkild Jacobsen has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, suggesting that the two languages were in use together for a significant period of time.   Context: The Semitic Akkadian language is first attested in proper names of the kings of Kish c. 2800 BC, preserved in later king lists. There are texts written entirely in Old Akkadian dating from c. 2500 BC. Use of Old Akkadian was at its peak during the rule of Sargon the Great (c. 2270–2215 BC), but even then most administrative tablets continued to be written in Sumerian, the language used by the scribes. Gelb and Westenholz differentiate three stages of Old Akkadian: that of the pre-Sargonic era, that of the Akkadian empire, and that of the "Neo-Sumerian Renaissance" that followed it. Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for about one thousand years, but by around 1800 BC, Sumerian was becoming more of a literary language familiar mainly only to scholars and scribes. Thorkild Jacobsen has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, and that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a "Semitic vs. Sumerian" conflict. However, it is certain that Akkadian was also briefly imposed on neighboring parts of Elam that were previously conquered by Sargon.   Score: 0.888524711

Question: What are the properties of glass that allow it to be transparent to visible light and have a smooth surface?   Answer: The properties of glass that allow it to be transparent to visible light and have a smooth surface are that it does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals, and that during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension. These properties give glass its clearness and can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.   Context: Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.   Score: 0.875358522

Question: How did the Russian invasion of Memel impact the course of the Seven Years' War?   Answer: The Russian invasion of Memel had a significant impact on the course of the Seven Years' War. It forced Frederick to break off his invasion of Bohemia and withdraw further into Prussian-controlled territory. It also brought more opportunist nations into the war, such as Sweden, which declared war on Prussia and invaded Pomerania with 17,000 men. This increased the pressure on Prussia and made it more difficult for them to fight on multiple fronts.   Context: Later that summer, the Russians invaded Memel with 75,000 troops. Memel had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia. However, after five days of artillery bombardment the Russian army was able to storm it. The Russians then used Memel as a base to invade East Prussia and defeated a smaller Prussian force in the fiercely contested Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August 1757. However, it was not yet able to take Königsberg and retreated soon afterward. Still, it was a new threat to Prussia. Not only was Frederick forced to break off his invasion of Bohemia, he was now forced to withdraw further into Prussian-controlled territory. His defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunist nations into the war. Sweden declared war on Prussia and invaded Pomerania with 17,000 men. Sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy Pomerania and felt the Swedish army would not need to engage with the Prussians because the Prussians were occupied on so many other fronts.

Question: What are some reasons why textual criticism has been particularly focused on the works of Shakespeare in the English language?   Answer: Some reasons why textual criticism has been particularly focused on the works of Shakespeare in the English language include: the texts, as transmitted, contain a considerable amount of variation; the effort and expense of producing superior editions of his works have always been widely viewed as worthwhile; and the principles of textual criticism, originally developed and refined for works of antiquity, the Bible, and Shakespeare, have been applied to many works.   Context: In the English language, the works of Shakespeare have been a particularly fertile ground for textual criticism—both because the texts, as transmitted, contain a considerable amount of variation, and because the effort and expense of producing superior editions of his works have always been widely viewed as worthwhile. The principles of textual criticism, although originally developed and refined for works of antiquity, the Bible, and Shakespeare, have been applied to many works, extending backwards from the present to the earliest known written documents, in Mesopotamia and Egypt—a period of about five millennia. However, the application of textual criticism to non-religious works does not antedate the invention of printing.

Question: What are the distinguishing characteristics of the absolute desert regions within the Sahara and how do they contribute to the extreme aridity of these areas?   Answer: The absolute desert regions within the Sahara are characterized by their extreme aridity, with little to no vegetation and virtually no rainfall. These regions are located in the central, hyperarid part of the desert, and are further subdivided into areas such as the Tanezrouft, the Ténéré, the Libyan Desert, the Eastern Desert, and the Nubian Desert. The stability of the atmosphere above the desert prevents any convective overturning, thus making rainfall virtually non-existent. The subtropical ridge is the predominate factor that explains the hot desert climate of this vast region, and the lowering of air is the strongest and the most effective over the eastern part of the Great Desert. This contributes to the extreme aridity of these areas, as the permanent dissolution of clouds allows unhindered light and thermal radiation, and subsiding, diverging, dry air masses associated with subtropical high-pressure systems are extremely unfavorable for the development of convectional showers.   Context: The central part of the Sahara is hyperarid, with little to no vegetation. The northern and southern reaches of the desert, along with the highlands, have areas of sparse grassland and desert shrub, with trees and taller shrubs in wadis where moisture collects. In the central, hyperarid part, there are many subdivisions of the great desert such as the Tanezrouft, the Ténéré, the Libyan Desert, the Eastern Desert, the Nubian Desert and others.

Answer: The key arguments presented in the Fisher v. University of Texas case regarding affirmative action in college admissions were that the University of Texas had a "race-conscious policy" that violated the civil and constitutional rights of Abigail Fisher and Rachel Multer Michalewicz. The Supreme Court's rulings on the case have had a significant impact on the use of race-conscious policies in college admissions. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the University must demonstrate that it could not achieve diversity through other, non-race sensitive means. In 2015, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case a second time, and it is likely to be decided by June 2016. The outcome of this case will have a major impact on the use of race-conscious policies in college admissions.   Context: In 2012, Abigail Fisher, an undergraduate student at Louisiana State University, and Rachel Multer Michalewicz, a law student at Southern Methodist University, filed a lawsuit to challenge the University of Texas admissions policy, asserting it had a "race-conscious policy" that "violated their civil and constitutional rights". The University of Texas employs the "Top Ten Percent Law", under which admission to any public college or university in Texas is guaranteed to high school students who graduate in the top ten percent of their high school class. Fisher has brought the admissions policy to court because she believes that she was denied acceptance to the University of Texas based on her race, and thus, her right to equal protection according to the 14th Amendment was violated. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Fisher on October 10, 2012, and rendered an ambiguous ruling in 2013 that sent the case back to the lower court, stipulating only that the University must demonstrate that it could not achieve diversity through other, non-race sensitive means. In July 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that U of T maintained a "holistic" approach in its application of affirmative action, and could continue the practice. On February 10, 2015, lawyers for Fisher filed a new case in the Supreme Court. It is a renewed complaint that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit got the issue wrong — on the second try as well as on the first.

Question: What were the main factors that contributed to the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924, and how did this event impact the perception of Catholicism in America at the time?   Answer: The main factors that contributed to the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924 were nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants. The KKK saw Notre Dame as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church, and the students were aware of the anti-Catholic animosity. This event had a significant impact on the perception of Catholicism in America at the time, as it showed that Catholics were willing to stand up for their beliefs and fight against bigotry and prejudice. The students' hostility towards the KKK was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana, which helped to reduce anti-Catholic sentiment in the country.   Context: The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name. The success of Note Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence.

Context: The Díaz administration made political decisions and took legal measures that allowed the elite throughout Mexico to concentrate the nation's wealth by favoring monopolies. During this time, two-fifths of the state's territory was divided among 17 rich families which owned practically all of the arable land in Chihuahua. The state economy grew at a rapid pace during the Porfiriato; the economy in Chihuahua was dominated by agriculture and mining. The Díaz administration helped Governor Luis Terrazas by funding the Municipal Public Library in Chihuahua City and passing a federal initiative for the construction of the railroad from Chihuahua City to Ciudad Júarez. By 1881, the Central Mexican Railroad was completed which connected Mexico City to Ciudad Juárez. In 1883 telephone lines were installed throughout the state, allowing communication between Chihuahua City and Aldama. By 1888 the telephone services were extended from the capital to the cites of Julimes, Meoqui, and Hidalgo del Parral; the telecommunication network in the state covered an estimated 3,500 kilometers. The need of laborers to construct the extensive infrastructure projects resulted in a significant Asian immigration, mostly from China. Asian immigrants soon become integral to the state economy by opening restaurants, small grocery stores, and hotels.

Question: What were some of the ways in which the Ptolemies incorporated Egyptian traditions and religious practices into their rule during the Hellenistic period?   Answer: The Ptolemies incorporated Egyptian traditions and religious practices into their rule during the Hellenistic period by marrying their siblings, having themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, participating in Egyptian religious life, and creating a new god, Serapis, which was a combination of two Egyptian gods: Apis and Osiris, with attributes of Greek gods. They also erected temples to the Ptolemies throughout the kingdom and established a centralized bureaucracy to manage the population and external possessions.

The Ptolemies took on the traditions of the Egyptian Pharaohs, such as marrying their siblings (Ptolemy II was the first to adopt this custom), having themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participating in Egyptian religious life. The Ptolemaic ruler cult portrayed the Ptolemies as gods, and temples to the Ptolemies were erected throughout the kingdom. Ptolemy I even created a new god, Serapis, who was combination of two Egyptian gods: Apis and Osiris, with attributes of Greek gods. Ptolemaic administration was, like the Ancient Egyptian bureaucracy, highly centralized and focused on squeezing as much revenue out of the population as possible though tariffs, excise duties, fines, taxes and so forth.

Additionally, they argued that the extra hour of daylight would not save energy, as most of their customers traveled by train and not by car.   Context: The war's end swung the pendulum back. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it after the war. Britain was an exception: it retained DST nationwide but over the years adjusted transition dates for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. The US was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden. Only a few US cities retained DST locally thereafter, including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York. Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding opposed DST as a "deception". Reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer, he ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 08:00 rather than 09:00 during summer 1922. Some businesses followed suit though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.   Score: 0.88485 
Question: What factors contribute to the prevalence of green eyes in different regions and ethnicities?   Answer: The prevalence of green eyes in different regions and ethnicities is largely due to genetic factors. Green eyes are most common in Northern and Central Europe, and are also found in Southern Europe, West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia. In Iceland, 89% of women and 87% of men have either blue or green eye color. Among European Americans, green eyes are most common among those of recent Celtic and Germanic ancestry, about 16%. The appearance of green eyes is caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of the stroma, given by a low or moderate concentration of melanin, with the blue tone imparted by the Rayleigh scattering of the reflected light.   Context: There is no green pigment in green eyes; like the color of blue eyes, it is an optical illusion; its appearance is caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of the stroma, given by a low or moderate concentration of melanin, with the blue tone imparted by the Rayleigh scattering of the reflected light. Green eyes are most common in Northern and Central Europe. They can also be found in Southern Europe, West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia. In Iceland, 89% of women and 87% of men have either blue or green eye color. A study of Icelandic and Dutch adults found green eyes to be much more prevalent in women than in men.

Question: What are the key differences in the way canon law is legislated, interpreted, and adjudicated among the Catholic Church, the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches, and the individual national churches within the Anglican Communion?   Answer: The key differences in the way canon law is legislated, interpreted, and adjudicated among the Catholic Church, the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches, and the individual national churches within the Anglican Communion are largely based on the individual traditions and customs of each church. For example, the Catholic Church has a hierarchical structure with the Pope at the top, while the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches have a more decentralized structure with each church having its own governing body. Additionally, the Anglican Communion is composed of individual national churches, each of which has its own set of laws and regulations. As such, the way that canon law is legislated, interpreted, and adjudicated can vary significantly between the different churches.   Context: Canon law is the body of laws and regulations made by ecclesiastical authority (Church leadership), for the government of a Christian organization or church and its members. It is the internal ecclesiastical law governing the Catholic Church (both Latin Church and Eastern Catholic Churches), the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches, and the individual national churches within the Anglican Communion. The way that such church law is legislated, interpreted and at times adjudicated varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was originally a rule adopted by a church council; these canons formed the foundation of canon law.   Score: 0.890570641

Question: What were the main factors that contributed to the "War of the Speeds" between RCA Victor and Columbia Records in the mid-20th century?   Answer: The main factors that contributed to the "War of the Speeds" between RCA Victor and Columbia Records in the mid-20th century were the introduction of RCA Victor's 7-inch (175 mm) 45 rpm disc as a competing vinyl format to Columbia Records, the lack of affordable and reliable consumer playback equipment, and consumer wariness during the Great Depression.   Context: The commercial rivalry between RCA Victor and Columbia Records led to RCA Victor's introduction of what it had intended to be a competing vinyl format, the 7-inch (175 mm) 45 rpm disc. For a two-year period from 1948 to 1950, record companies and consumers faced uncertainty over which of these formats would ultimately prevail in what was known as the "War of the Speeds". (See also format war.) In 1949 Capitol and Decca adopted the new LP format and RCA gave in and issued its first LP in January 1950.

Question: What impact did the portrayal of samurai characters in American comic books and films have on the perception of samurai culture in American society?   Answer: The portrayal of samurai characters in American comic books and films had a significant impact on the perception of samurai culture in American society. The characters depicted in these mediums helped to make the samurai way of life more accessible and relatable to American audiences. The characters were often portrayed as heroic figures, which helped to create a positive image of samurai culture. This positive image was further reinforced by films such as The Last Samurai, which depicted the samurai as honorable warriors fighting for a noble cause. As a result, the samurai have become a popular figure in American culture, with many people having a greater appreciation for the samurai way of life.   Context: In his book "Ideals of the Samurai" translator William Scott Wilson states: "The warriors in the Heike Monogatari served as models for the educated warriors of later generations, and the ideals depicted by them were not assumed to be beyond reach. Rather, these ideals were vigorously pursued in the upper echelons of warrior society and recommended as the proper form of the Japanese man of arms. With the Heike Monogatari, the image of the Japanese warrior in literature came to its full maturity."

Question: What is the significance of Karl Popper's criterion of falsifiability in the creation-evolution controversy and how does it shape the debate on whether creationistic ideas and evolution can be considered legitimate science?   Answer: Karl Popper's criterion of falsifiability is significant in the creation-evolution controversy because it provides a way to evaluate whether a given idea or theory is scientific or not. According to Popper, a scientific theory must be testable and falsifiable in order to be considered legitimate science. This means that a theory must be able to be tested and proven wrong in order to be considered scientific. This criterion has shaped the debate on whether creationistic ideas and evolution can be considered legitimate science by providing a way to evaluate the scientific validity of each. By applying Popper's criterion of falsifiability, both sides of the debate can evaluate the scientific validity of their respective theories and determine whether they are legitimate science or not.   Context: The creation–evolution controversy in the United States raises the issue of whether creationistic ideas may be legitimately called science and whether evolution itself may be legitimately called science. In the debate, both sides and even courts in their decisions have frequently invoked Popper's criterion of falsifiability (see Daubert standard). In this context, passages written by Popper are frequently quoted in which he speaks about such issues himself. For example, he famously stated "Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program—a possible framework for testable scientific theories."

Question: How did the Queen's decision to shield her grandsons from the press at Balmoral impact the public's perception of the royal family during the aftermath of Princess Diana's death?   Answer: The Queen's decision to shield her grandsons from the press at Balmoral initially caused public dismay, as it was seen as a sign of the royal family's seclusion and lack of respect for Diana's death. However, after the Queen agreed to return to London and do a live television broadcast expressing her admiration for Diana and her feelings for her grandsons, much of the public hostility evaporated. The Queen's decision to show her support for her grandsons in such a public way was seen as a sign of respect for Diana and helped to restore the public's perception of the royal family.   Context: In 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The Queen was on holiday with her extended family at Balmoral. Diana's two sons by Charles—Princes William and Harry—wanted to attend church and so the Queen and Prince Philip took them that morning. After that single public appearance, for five days the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private, but the royal family's seclusion and the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace caused public dismay. Pressured by the hostile reaction, the Queen agreed to return to London and do a live television broadcast on 5 September, the day before Diana's funeral. In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings "as a grandmother" for the two princes. As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated.   Score: 0.880637825 
Question: What evidence supports the prevailing theories of human migration from Asia to the Americas via Beringia?   Answer: Evidence supporting the prevailing theories of human migration from Asia to the Americas via Beringia includes archaeological evidence of human remains and artifacts found in the Americas that date back to at least 13,500 years ago, oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas that suggest they have been living there since their genesis, and evidence suggesting big-game hunter gatherers crossed the Bering Strait from Asia (Eurasia) into North America over a land bridge (Beringia) that existed between 47,000–14,000 years ago.   Context: According to the prevailing theories of the settlement of the Americas, migrations of humans from Asia (in particular North Asia) to the Americas took place via Beringia, a land bridge which connected the two continents across what is now the Bering Strait. The majority of experts agree that the earliest pre-modern human migration via Beringia took place at least 13,500 years ago, with disputed evidence that people had migrated into the Americas much earlier, up to 40,000 years ago.

He viewed the relationship between individuals and society in relation to religion as one in which individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, but that religion is ultimately an individual experience.   Context: For Whitehead the core of religion was individual. While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others. His most famous remark on religion is that "religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious." Whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person's character.

Answer: The decline of commercial solar water heaters in the United States in the 1920s was due to the availability of cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. The oil crises of the 1970s caused a renewed interest in solar water heating, as it was seen as a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional heating fuels. The falling petroleum prices of the 1980s caused a decrease in interest, but the development of solar water heating technologies in the 1990s led to a steady growth in the sector.   Context: Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. As with photovoltaics, solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and growth rates have averaged 20% per year since 1999.

Question: What is the significance of treaties being classified as either "self-executing" or "non-self-executing" in terms of their implementation and fulfillment of obligations by state parties?   Answer: The significance of treaties being classified as either "self-executing" or "non-self-executing" is that it determines whether or not a state party needs to pass implementing legislation in order to fulfill its obligations under the treaty. Self-executing treaties are automatically put into action when a state party becomes a signatory, while non-self-executing treaties require the state party to pass domestic laws in order to fulfill its obligations. If a state fails to pass the necessary legislation, it may be in default of its obligations.   Context: Treaties may be seen as 'self-executing', in that merely becoming a party puts the treaty and all of its obligations in action. Other treaties may be non-self-executing and require 'implementing legislation'—a change in the domestic law of a state party that will direct or enable it to fulfill treaty obligations.

Christopher Clavius, the architect of the Gregorian calendar, noted that the tables agreed neither on the time when the sun passed through the vernal equinox nor on the length of the mean tropical year. Tycho Brahe also noticed discrepancies. The Gregorian leap year rule (97 leap years in 400 years) was put forward by Petrus Pitatus of Verona in 1560. He noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the Alfonsine tables and with the mean tropical year of Copernicus (De revolutionibus) and Reinhold (Prutenic tables). The three mean tropical years in Babylonian sexagesimals as the excess over 365 days (the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude) were 14,33,9,57 (Alphonsine), 14,33,11,12 (Copernicus) and 14,33,9,24 (Reinhold).

Question: What are the key differences between Islamic education and Muslim education, and how does the concept of epistemological integration play a role in Islamic education?   Answer: The key difference between Islamic education and Muslim education is that Islamic education has an epistemological integration which is founded on Tawhid (Oneness or monotheism). This means that Islamic education is based on the teachings of the Quran and is focused on understanding the Oneness of God and the unity of all knowledge. Epistemological integration is the process of combining different areas of knowledge to form a unified understanding of the world. In Islamic education, this integration is used to bring together the teachings of the Quran and other areas of knowledge, such as science, philosophy, and history, to form a holistic understanding of the world. This integration is used to help students gain a deeper understanding of the teachings of the Quran and how they relate to the world around them.

Question: What are the similarities and differences between Galen's and Descartes' theories about the brain and nervous system?   Answer: The similarities between Galen's and Descartes' theories about the brain and nervous system are that both believed that the brain and nervous system were connected to the muscles in the body through a branching network of nerves, and that nerves activate muscles mechanically. Both also believed that the majority of behaviors of humans and all behaviors of animals could be explained mechanistically. The differences between Galen's and Descartes' theories about the brain and nervous system are that Galen postulated that nerves activate muscles by carrying a mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon, while Descartes believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non-physical res cogitans. Additionally, Galen's ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages, while Descartes' theories were developed during the Renaissance.   Context: The Roman physician Galen also argued for the importance of the brain, and theorized in some depth about how it might work. Galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain, nerves, and muscles, demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves. He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon, usually translated as "animal spirits". Galen's ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages, but not much further progress came until the Renaissance, when detailed anatomical study resumed, combined with the theoretical speculations of René Descartes and those who followed him.

Question: What factors influenced the shift in the use of the veto power by the Presidents of the United States, particularly with Andrew Jackson being the first to use it as a political weapon?   Answer: The shift in the use of the veto power by the Presidents of the United States was largely influenced by Andrew Jackson's belief in a strong executive. Jackson was the first President to use the veto as a political weapon, and he used it to direct national policy. His successors, such as Andrew Johnson, also used the veto to counterbalance Congress, particularly during the Reconstruction period. Additionally, Congress attempted to limit the power of the presidency by passing the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval for the dismissal of senior Cabinet officials. This further encouraged the use of the veto power by the Presidents of the United States.   Context: The first six presidents of the United States did not make extensive use of the veto power: George Washington only vetoed two bills, James Monroe one, and John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams none. James Madison, a firm believer in a strong executive, vetoed seven bills. None of the first six Presidents, however, used the veto to direct national policy. It was Andrew Jackson, the seventh President, who was the first to use the veto as a political weapon. During his two terms in office, he vetoed twelve bills—more than all of his predecessors combined. Furthermore, he defied the Supreme Court in enforcing the policy of ethnically cleansing Native American tribes ("Indian Removal"); he stated (perhaps apocryphally), "John Marshall has made his decision. Now let him enforce it!"   Score: 0.889205635

Question: What are the different ways in which a wrestler can indicate a voluntary submission in professional wrestling?   Answer: The different ways in which a wrestler can indicate a voluntary submission in professional wrestling are: verbally informing the referee, tapping a free hand against the mat or against an opponent (known as "tapping out"), and reaching for a rope.   Context: A wrestler may voluntarily submit by verbally informing the referee (usually used in moves such as the Mexican Surfboard, where all four limbs are incapacitated, making tapping impossible). Also, since Ken Shamrock (a legitimate UFC competitor in its early days) popularized it in 1997, a wrestler can indicate a voluntary submission by "tapping out", that is, tapping a free hand against the mat or against an opponent. Occasionally, a wrestler will reach for a rope (see rope breaks below), only to put their hand back on the mat so they can crawl towards the rope some more; this is not a submission, and the referee decides what their intent is.

Question: What significant contributions did David Hilbert and Max Planck make to the development of modern physics, and how did Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger build upon their work?   Answer: David Hilbert and Max Planck laid the foundation for modern physics by introducing new theories and concepts. Hilbert proposed the axiomatic approach to mathematics, which provided a rigorous foundation for the study of physics. Planck developed the quantum theory of energy, which proposed that energy is emitted and absorbed in discrete packets, or quanta. Heisenberg and Schrödinger built upon this work by developing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, which provided a framework for understanding the behavior of matter on the atomic and subatomic level. This work revolutionized the field of physics and led to the development of new technologies and applications.   Context: The work of David Hilbert and Max Planck was crucial to the foundation of modern physics, which Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger developed further. They were preceded by such key physicists as Hermann von Helmholtz, Joseph von Fraunhofer, and Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit, among others.

Question: How did the principle of partus sequitur ventrem affect interracial relationships and marriages during the colonial years and the era of slavery in the British colonies?   Answer: The principle of partus sequitur ventrem gave children the social status of their mother, regardless of the father's race or citizenship. This overturned the principle in English common law by which a man gave his status to his children, which had enabled communities to demand that fathers support their children, whether legitimate or not. The change increased white men's ability to use slave women sexually, as they had no responsibility for the children. This allowed white men to use mixed-race children born into slavery as servants or laborers or sell them as slaves, and also allowed them to abandon the mixed-race children and their mothers to slavery.   Context: Interracial relationships, common-law marriages, and marriages occurred since the earliest colonial years, especially before slavery hardened as a racial caste associated with people of African descent in the British colonies. Virginia and other English colonies passed laws in the 17th century that gave children the social status of their mother, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, regardless of the father's race or citizenship. This overturned the principle in English common law by which a man gave his status to his children – this had enabled communities to demand that fathers support their children, whether legitimate or not. The change increased white men's ability to use slave women sexually, as they had no responsibility for the children. As master as well as father of mixed-race children born into slavery, the men could use these people as servants or laborers or sell them as slaves. In some cases, white fathers provided for their multiracial children, paying or arranging for education or apprenticeships and freeing them, particularly during the two decades following the American Revolution. (The practice of providing for the children was more common in French and Spanish colonies, where a class of free people of color developed who became educated and property owners.) Many other white fathers abandoned the mixed-race children and their mothers to slavery.   Score: 0.890026391 
Question: What role did the creation of the public sphere play in the rise of the modern nation state and capitalism?   Answer: The creation of the public sphere played a key role in the rise of the modern nation state and capitalism by providing a private realm of society independent of the state, which allowed for the exchange of information and the development of autonomy and self-awareness. This increased efficiency in production techniques and communication, lowered the prices of consumer goods, and increased the amount and variety of goods available to consumers. Additionally, the colonial experience exposed European society to heterogeneous cultures, leading to the breaking down of barriers between cultural systems, religious divides, gender differences, and geographical areas.   Context: The creation of the public sphere has been associated with two long-term historical trends: the rise of the modern nation state and the rise of capitalism. The modern nation state, in its consolidation of public power, created by counterpoint a private realm of society independent of the state, which allowed for the public sphere. Capitalism also increased society's autonomy and self-awareness, and an increasing need for the exchange of information. As the nascent public sphere expanded, it embraced a large variety of institutions; the most commonly cited were coffee houses and cafés, salons and the literary public sphere, figuratively localized in the Republic of Letters. In France, the creation of the public sphere was helped by the aristocracy's move from the King's palace at Versailles to Paris in about 1720, since their rich spending stimulated the trade in luxuries and artistic creations, especially fine paintings.

Question: What are the distinguishing features between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, and why are they not extensively investigated despite sharing similar management principles?   Answer: The distinguishing features between COPD and asthma are increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi for COPD, and increased exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy for asthma. These features are not extensively investigated due to the fact that both COPD and asthma share similar principles of management, such as corticosteroids, long acting beta agonists, and smoking cessation.   Context: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma. After the age of 65 most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long acting beta agonists, and smoking cessation.

Question: What evidence supports the claim that Alexander Graham Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only as a proof of concept scientific experiment after Bell's patent had been granted?   Answer: The evidence that supports the claim that Alexander Graham Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only as a proof of concept scientific experiment after Bell's patent had been granted is that Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone after March 1876 and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use. Additionally, Elisha Gray filed a caveat with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter on February 14, 1876, the same morning that Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the patent office. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26. This suggests that Bell was not aware of Gray's patent caveat until after his own patent had been granted.   Context: Although Bell was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray, Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only after Bell's patent had been granted, and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment, to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible "articulate speech" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.

Question: What factors should a prospective user consider when researching the best choice among different available MP3 encoders?   Answer: A prospective user should consider the quality of the encoder, the difficulty of the signal being encoded, the bit rate of the encoded audio, and the reviews and comparisons of the different encoders.   Context: Besides the bit rate of an encoded piece of audio, the quality of MP3 files also depends on the quality of the encoder itself, and the difficulty of the signal being encoded. As the MP3 standard allows quite a bit of freedom with encoding algorithms, different encoders may feature quite different quality, even with identical bit rates. As an example, in a public listening test featuring two different MP3 encoders at about 128 kbit/s, one scored 3.66 on a 1–5 scale, while the other scored only 2.22.   Score: 0.856790841

The sales competition between West's Graduation and rapper 50 Cent's Curtis highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade, with the former being a more introspective and glossy rap, while the latter was gangsta rap for the noughties. The success of Graduation encouraged other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, and also played a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s.

Early in his career, he was among the first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of homophobia in hip hop. The sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold. Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the sales competition as a historical moment in hip-hop, because it "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative." Rolling Stone credited West with transforming hip hop's mainstream, "establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap [...]", and called him "as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced—a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful things to say about college, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up." His 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak polarized both listeners and critics upon its release, but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically, as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Drake, Future, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief Keef, and Soulja Boy.

Question: What factors contribute to the significant role of mining in Namibia's economy and its position as a major exporter of non-fuel minerals in Africa?   Answer: The significant role of mining in Namibia's economy and its position as a major exporter of non-fuel minerals in Africa is largely due to the country's abundance of natural resources. Namibia is home to rich alluvial diamond deposits, as well as uranium, lead, tungsten, gold, tin, fluorspar, manganese, marble, copper and zinc deposits. Additionally, there are offshore gas deposits in the Atlantic Ocean that are planned to be extracted in the future. Furthermore, the country's constitution specifically addresses conservation and protection of natural resources, which has helped to ensure that these resources are used in a sustainable manner. Finally, the presence of De Beers, the largest diamond company, has also contributed to Namibia's success in the mining industry, as the company has bought most of the country's diamonds since 1978.   Context: Providing 25% of Namibia's revenue, mining is the single most important contributor to the economy. Namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in Africa and the world's fourth largest producer of uranium. There has been significant investment in uranium mining and Namibia is set to become the largest exporter of uranium by 2015.

Question: What were the key factors that led to the rise of Sikhism and the establishment of the Sikh Empire in Punjab under Maharaja Ranjit Singh?   Answer: The key factors that led to the rise of Sikhism and the establishment of the Sikh Empire in Punjab under Maharaja Ranjit Singh were the increasing adoption of Sikhism by Hindus during the Mughal Empire, the formidable military force of the Sikhs against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire, and the Bhangi Misl's conquest of Lahore and other towns of Punjab. Additionally, the jihad waged by Syed Ahmad Barelvi and his attempt to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law, as well as the professional Sikh Army led by Ranjit Singh, were also key factors in the rise of Sikhism and the establishment of the Sikh Empire.   Context: In the mid-fifteenth century, the religion of Sikhism was born. During the Mughal empire, many Hindus increasingly adopted Sikhism. These became a formidable military force against the Mughals and later against the Afghan Empire. After fighting Ahmad Shah Durrani in the later eighteenth century, the Sikhs took control of Punjab and managed to establish the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, which lasted from 1799 to 1849. The capital of Ranjit Singh's empire was Lahore, and the empire also extended into Afghanistan and Kashmir. Bhangi Misl was the fist Sikh band to conquer Lahore and other towns of Punjab.

Additionally, Whitehead's "almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy" made it difficult for Lowe to gain access to any personal information about Whitehead.   Context: The two volume biography of Whitehead by Victor Lowe is the most definitive presentation of the life of Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no Nachlass; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death. Additionally, Whitehead was known for his "almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy", and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life. This led to Lowe himself remarking on the first page of Whitehead's biography, "No professional biographer in his right mind would touch him."   Score: 0.893395126 
Question: What factors contributed to the low number of legal ennoblements issued in Poland between the 14th and mid-18th centuries, and how did this compare to the historical demography of the country?   Answer: The low number of legal ennoblements issued in Poland between the 14th and mid-18th centuries was likely due to a combination of factors, including the limited availability of resources, the difficulty of obtaining a noble title, and the strict requirements for ennoblement. This was in stark contrast to the historical demography of the country, which was much larger and more diverse. The population of Poland during this period was much larger than the number of ennoblements issued, making the ratio of ennoblements to population very small.   Context: According to heraldic sources total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century, is estimated at approximately 800. This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year or only 0.000 000 14 – 0.000 001 of historical population. Compare: historical demography of Poland.   Score: 0.896437 
Question: What challenges do contemporary historians face in understanding the ancient culture and knowledge of pre-Columbian civilizations due to the destruction of many written records by European colonists?   Answer: Contemporary historians face the challenge of having to rely on oral history and archaeological investigations to understand the ancient culture and knowledge of pre-Columbian civilizations due to the destruction of many written records by European colonists. This makes it difficult to gain a full understanding of the culture and knowledge of these civilizations, as the written records were often the most comprehensive source of information. Additionally, the oral histories may be incomplete or inaccurate, and archaeological investigations can be limited in scope.   Context: Many pre-Columbian civilizations established characteristics and hallmarks which included permanent or urban settlements, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and complex societal hierarchies. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first significant European and African arrivals (ca. late 15th–early 16th centuries), and are known only through oral history and through archaeological investigations. Others were contemporary with this period, and are also known from historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Mayan, Olmec, Mixtec, and Nahua peoples, had their own written records. However, the European colonists of the time worked to eliminate non-Christian beliefs, and Christian pyres destroyed many pre-Columbian written records. Only a few documents remained hidden and survived, leaving contemporary historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.   Score: 0.861488879 
Question: What are some distinguishing characteristics of Saint Barthélemy that reflect its unique history as a Swedish colony and its current French influence?   Answer: Some distinguishing characteristics of Saint Barthélemy that reflect its unique history as a Swedish colony and its current French influence include: the Three Crowns symbol from the Swedish national arms appearing in the island's coat of arms, the language, cuisine, and culture being distinctly French, and the island being a popular tourist destination during the winter holiday season.   Context: Saint Barthélemy, a volcanic island fully encircled by shallow reefs, has an area of 25 square kilometres (9.7 sq mi) and a population of 9,035 (Jan. 2011 estimate). Its capital is Gustavia[citation needed], which also contains the main harbour to the island. It is the only Caribbean island which was a Swedish colony for any significant length of time; Guadeloupe was under Swedish rule only briefly at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Symbolism from the Swedish national arms, the Three Crowns, still appears in the island's coat of arms. The language, cuisine, and culture, however, are distinctly French.

Question: What are the key differences between the early teachings of Buddhism and the Mahayana sutras in terms of their intended audience and levels of spiritual understanding?   Answer: The early teachings of Buddhism were intended for a general audience and were meant to provide a basic understanding of Buddhist principles. The Mahayana sutras, on the other hand, were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding. They were meant to provide a more advanced understanding of Buddhist principles and to help those with a more advanced spiritual understanding to progress further in their spiritual journey.   Context: The Mahayana sutras are a very broad genre of Buddhist scriptures that the Mahayana Buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of the Buddha. Some adherents of Mahayana accept both the early teachings (including in this the Sarvastivada Abhidharma, which was criticized by Nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early Buddhist thought) and the Mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of Gautama Buddha, and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding.

Question: What were some of the reasons that led Barthélémy Boganda to establish the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN) in 1950?   Answer: Some of the reasons that led Barthélémy Boganda to establish the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN) in 1950 were his political stance against racism and the colonial regime, as well as his growing disillusionment with the French political system. He wanted to create a movement that would promote social and political change in the Central African Republic and the wider African continent.   Context: In September 1940, during the Second World War, pro-Gaullist French officers took control of Ubangi-Shari and General Leclerc established his headquarters for the Free French Forces in Bangui. In 1946 Barthélémy Boganda was elected with 9,000 votes to the French National Assembly, becoming the first representative for CAR in the French government.

Question: What evidence supports the claim that the discovered Quran fragments are possibly the earliest extant exemplar of the Quran?   Answer: The evidence that supports the claim that the discovered Quran fragments are possibly the earliest extant exemplar of the Quran is the radiocarbon dating tests carried out by Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, which determined that the parchment was from between 568 and 645 with a probability of more than 95%. Additionally, the manuscript is written in Hijazi script, an early form of written Arabic, which further supports the claim that the fragments are possibly the earliest extant exemplar of the Quran.

Question: What were the main reasons for the hostility between the British and the neighboring Overhill Cherokees in Tennessee during the 18th century?   Answer: The main reasons for the hostility between the British and the neighboring Overhill Cherokees in Tennessee during the 18th century were due to the British presence in the area and the encroachment of British settlers on Cherokee land. The Cherokees were also concerned about the British trading of guns and alcohol to the Native Americans, which they believed would lead to increased violence and disruption of their traditional way of life. Additionally, the British were seen as a threat to the sovereignty of the Cherokee Nation.

Question: What factors contributed to the decline in Philadelphia's population in the mid-20th century and how has the city managed to reverse this trend in recent decades?   Answer: The decline in Philadelphia's population in the mid-20th century was largely due to the restructuring of industry, which led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs, as well as suburbanization, which drew off many of the wealthier residents to outlying towns. In recent decades, the city has managed to reverse this trend by attracting service businesses and aggressively marketing itself as a tourist destination. Additionally, historic areas such as Independence National Historical Park and Society Hill have been renovated, making them desirable living areas and slowing the city's population decline.   Context: In 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population. The population peaked at more than two million residents in 1950, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry, which led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization had been drawing off many of the wealthier residents to outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. Revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century, with much of the development in the Center City and University City areas of the city. After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination. Glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City. Historic areas such as Independence National Historical Park located in Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s.

Question: What are the contrasting perspectives of Apollo and the Furies in regards to the justification of matricide, and how does their differing interpretation of the importance of marriage and blood relations contribute to the conflict?   Answer: Apollo and the Furies have contrasting perspectives on the justification of matricide. Apollo believes that the bond of marriage is sacred and that Orestes was justified in avenging his father, while the Erinyes argue that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. This difference in interpretation of the importance of marriage and blood relations contributes to the conflict between Apollo and the Furies, as they are unable to come to an agreement on the justification of Orestes' actions. Apollo's view is that Orestes was justified in avenging his father, while the Erinyes believe that the bond of blood between mother and son is more important than the bond of marriage. This disagreement leads to the Furies invading Apollo's temple and demanding that the matter be brought before Athena.   Context: Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the matricide was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage.

Question: How did the struggle between the patricians and the plebeians influence the evolution of the Roman government?   Answer: The struggle between the patricians and the plebeians had a significant influence on the evolution of the Roman government. The patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, had exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices, which were gradually repealed or weakened as the plebeians gained more power. This allowed leading plebeian families to become full members of the aristocracy, and the leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war. As the plebeians grew poorer, they began to flood into Rome and the legislative assemblies, and their poverty often led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. This created a new culture of dependency, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.   Context: Roman government was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations.

Question: What factors led to Cuba's exclusion from the 2010 Human Development Index report, and how was this issue addressed in subsequent years?   Answer: The main factor that led to Cuba's exclusion from the 2010 Human Development Index report was the lack of an "internationally reported figure for Cuba’s Gross National Income adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity". All other indicators for Cuba were available, but the lack of this one indicator meant that no ranking could be attributed to the country. The situation was addressed in subsequent years, and Cuba has since been ranked as a High Human Development country.   Context: Some countries were not included for various reasons, mainly the unavailability of certain crucial data. The following United Nations Member States were not included in the 2010 report. Cuba lodged a formal protest at its lack of inclusion. The UNDP explained that Cuba had been excluded due to the lack of an "internationally reported figure for Cuba’s Gross National Income adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity". All other indicators for Cuba were available, and reported by the UNDP, but the lack of one indicator meant that no ranking could be attributed to the country.

Question: What were the founders of Northwestern University's stance on admissions and who did they believe the university should serve?   Answer: The founders of Northwestern University were committed to non-sectarian admissions and believed that the university should serve all people in the newly developing territory.   Context: The foundation of Northwestern University is traceable to a meeting on May 31, 1850 of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once been known as the Northwest Territory. On January 28, 1851, the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North-Western University, making it the first chartered university in Illinois. The school's nine founders, all of whom were Methodists (three of them ministers), knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting. Although they affiliated the university with the Methodist Episcopal Church, they were committed to non-sectarian admissions, believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory.

Question: What is the average number of days with "heavy rain" in Cork city?   Answer: 73 days   Context: Temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) or above 25 °C (77 °F) are rare. Cork Airport records an average of 1,227.9 millimetres (4.029 ft) of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. The airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year. The low altitude of the city, and moderating influences of the harbour, mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself. There are on average 204 "rainy" days a year (over 0.2 millimetres (0.0079 in) of rainfall), of which there are 73 days with "heavy rain" (over 5 millimetres (0.20 in)). Cork is also a generally foggy city, with an average of 97 days of fog a year, most common during mornings and during winter. Despite this, however, Cork is also one of Ireland's sunniest cities, with an average of 3.9 hours of sunshine every day and only having 67 days where there is no "recordable sunshine", mostly during and around winter.

Question: What are the different types of economic activities that children involved in child labour are engaged in, and what are the percentages of children involved in each activity?   Answer: The different types of economic activities that children involved in child labour are engaged in are agricultural activities (60%), service activities (25%), and assembly and manufacturing in informal economy, home-based enterprises, factories, mines, packaging salt, operating machinery, and such operations (15%).   Context: Child labour is still common in many parts of the world. Estimates for child labour vary. It ranges between 250 and 304 million, if children aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted. If light occasional work is excluded, ILO estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008. This is about 20 million less than ILO estimate for child labourers in 2004. Some 60 percent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming, dairy, fisheries and forestry. Another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail, hawking goods, restaurants, load and transfer of goods, storage, picking and recycling trash, polishing shoes, domestic help, and other services. The remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy, home-based enterprises, factories, mines, packaging salt, operating machinery, and such operations.

Question: How did the Umayyads reform their army organization and what changes did they make to the Diwan of Umar's annuity system?   Answer: The Umayyads reformed their army organization by dividing it into five corps: the centre, two wings, vanguards and rearguards, following the same formation while on march or on a battle field. Marwan II (740–50) abandoned the old division and introduced Kurdus (cohort), a small compact body. The Umayyad troops were divided into three divisions: infantry, cavalry and artillery. Arab troops were dressed and armed in Greek fashion. The Umayyads meddled with the Diwan of Umar's annuity system, and the recipients regarded pensions as the subsistence allowance even without being in active service. Hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in battle.   Context: The Diwan of Umar, assigning annuities to all Arabs and to the Muslim soldiers of other races, underwent a change in the hands of the Umayyads. The Umayyads meddled with the register and the recipients regarded pensions as the subsistence allowance even without being in active service. Hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in battle.

Question: What was the process behind the creation and selection of the state song of Montana?   Answer: The process behind the creation and selection of the state song of Montana began when a musical troupe led by Joseph E. Howard stopped in Butte in September 1910. A former member of the troupe who lived in Butte asked Howard to compose a song about Montana and got another partygoer, the city editor for the Butte Miner newspaper, Charles C. Cohan, to help.

Question: How did the presence of violence in the game Mortal Kombat affect the sales of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) version compared to the Genesis version?   Answer: The presence of violence in the game Mortal Kombat had a negative effect on the sales of the SNES version compared to the Genesis version. The Genesis version retained the gore while the SNES version did not, resulting in the Genesis version outselling the SNES version by a ratio of three or four-to-one.   Context: The company continued to carefully review submitted titles, giving them scores using a 40-point scale and allocating Nintendo's marketing resources accordingly. Each region performed separate evaluations. Nintendo of America also maintained a policy that, among other things, limited the amount of violence in the games on its systems. One game, Mortal Kombat, would challenge this policy. A surprise hit in arcades in 1992, Mortal Kombat features splashes of blood and finishing moves that often depict one character dismembering the other.

Question: How did the requirement for verbal disclaimers in political advertisements on television impact the distinction between official and independent campaigning during the United States presidential election in 2004?   Answer: The requirement for verbal disclaimers in political advertisements on television during the United States presidential election in 2004 helped to clearly distinguish official campaigning from independent campaigning. The verbal disclaimers allowed viewers to easily identify who was responsible for the advertisement, whether it was the candidate or an independent organization. This helped to ensure that independent organizations were not able to mention any candidate by name in their advertisements, which was prohibited from September 3 (60 days before the general election).   Context: To distinguish official campaigning from independent campaigning, political advertisements on television were required to include a verbal disclaimer identifying the organization responsible for the advertisement. Advertisements produced by political campaigns usually included the statement, "I'm [candidate's name], and I approve this message." Advertisements produced by independent organizations usually included the statement, "[Organization name] is responsible for the content of this advertisement", and from September 3 (60 days before the general election), such organizations' ads were prohibited from mentioning any candidate by name.

Question: What are some characteristics that differentiate emotions from moods, and how do they play a role in human experiences?   Answer: Emotions are typically more intense and have a contextual stimulus, while moods are more diffuse and lack a specific trigger. Emotions are usually brief in duration and involve a coordinated set of responses, such as verbal, physiological, behavioural, and neural mechanisms. Moods, on the other hand, tend to be more long-lasting and less intense. Emotions play a significant role in human experiences, as they are often the driving force behind our decisions and actions. They can also be used to express our feelings and communicate with others. Moods, on the other hand, are more subtle and can influence our overall outlook and attitude. They can also affect our motivation and energy levels.   Context: Emotions have been described by some theorists as discrete and consistent responses to internal or external events which have a particular significance for the organism. Emotions are brief in duration and consist of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, physiological, behavioural, and neural mechanisms. Psychotherapist Michael C. Graham describes all emotions as existing on a continuum of intensity. Thus fear might range from mild concern to terror or shame might range from simple embarrassment to toxic shame.

Question: What are some of the key challenges faced by Ann Arbor in recent decades and how have they affected the city's development and urban sprawl?   Answer: Ann Arbor has faced several key challenges in recent decades, including sharply rising land values, gentrification, and urban sprawl stretching into outlying countryside. These challenges have had a significant impact on the city's development and urban sprawl. In response to these challenges, the city government has implemented a greenbelt plan, which has allowed them to buy development rights on agricultural parcels of land adjacent to Ann Arbor in order to preserve them from sprawling development. This has sparked a local debate on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits. Despite these challenges, Ann Arbor has consistently ranked in the "top places to live" lists published by various mainstream media outlets every year.   Context: In the past several decades, Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values, gentrification, and urban sprawl stretching into outlying countryside. On 4 November 2003, voters approved a greenbelt plan under which the city government bought development rights on agricultural parcels of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development.

Question: What were some of the significant assassination plots faced by Napoleon during the Consulate, and how did they impact the political landscape of Europe?   Answer: During the Consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin assassination plots, including the Conspiration des poignards (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also known as the Infernal Machine) two months later. In January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family, the former rulers of France. The execution of the Duke of Enghien, who had not been involved in the plot, in response to these assassination plots outraged royal courts throughout Europe and became one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. The execution of the Duke of Enghien was seen as a violation of the sovereignty of Baden and further increased tensions between France and the other European powers. This ultimately led to the Napoleonic Wars, which had a significant impact on the political landscape of Europe.

Question: What were the reasons behind the withdrawal and reconstitution of Canadian Presbyterians as a non-concurring continuing Presbyterian body in 1939?   Answer: The reasons behind the withdrawal and reconstitution of Canadian Presbyterians as a non-concurring continuing Presbyterian body in 1939 were due to their disagreement with the 1925 merger of the majority of Presbyterians with the Methodist Church, Canada, and the Congregational Union of Canada to form the United Church of Canada. The minority of Canadian Presbyterians felt that the merger was not in line with their beliefs and values, and thus withdrew and reconstituted themselves as a non-concurring continuing Presbyterian body.   Context: In Canada, the largest Presbyterian denomination – and indeed the largest Protestant denomination – was the Presbyterian Church in Canada, formed in 1875 with the merger of four regional groups. In 1925, the United Church of Canada was formed by the majority of Presbyterians combining with the Methodist Church, Canada, and the Congregational Union of Canada. A sizable minority of Canadian Presbyterians, primarily in southern Ontario but also throughout the entire nation, withdrew, and reconstituted themselves as a non-concurring continuing Presbyterian body.

Question: What impact did the bad weather have on Chopin's health during his time on the island?   Answer: The bad weather had a detrimental effect on Chopin's health, causing Sand to determine to leave the island.   Context: Although this period had been productive, the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts.[n 8] The group traveled first to Barcelona, then to Marseilles, where they stayed for a few months while Chopin convalesced. In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at Nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue Pigalle.

Question: What were some of the controversies surrounding Queen Victoria's relationship with Abdul Karim and how did she respond to them?   Answer: The controversy surrounding Queen Victoria's relationship with Abdul Karim was that her family and retainers accused him of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby also discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage. Queen Victoria dismissed these complaints as racial prejudice and continued to keep Abdul Karim in her service until his return to India with a pension on her death.   Context: In 1887, the British Empire celebrated Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to "Munshi": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, "the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do."

Question: What were the consequences of Caesar's assassination on the Roman Republic and how did it contribute to the outbreak of war between Mark Antony and Gaius Octavianus?   Answer: The consequences of Caesar's assassination on the Roman Republic were far-reaching. The Senate and assemblies were rendered powerless, and a civil war broke out between the two factions led by Mark Antony and Gaius Octavianus. The conspirators were defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, but Antony and Octavian eventually fought against each other in one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and Octavian returned to Rome as the unchallenged master of the Empire. This ultimately led to the end of the Roman Republic and the establishment of the Roman Empire under Augustus.   Context: Caesar was now the primary figure of the Roman state, enforcing and entrenching his powers. His enemies feared that he had ambitions to become an autocratic ruler. Arguing that the Roman Republic was in danger, a group of senators hatched a conspiracy and assassinated Caesar at a meeting of the Senate in March 44 BC.  Mark Antony, Caesar's lieutenant, condemned Caesar's assassination, and war broke out between the two factions.

Answer: The consequences of the disagreement between Prime Minister Josip Broz Tito and Aloysius Stepinac regarding the state of the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia included the Vatican excommunicating Tito and the Yugoslav government, Stepinac being arrested and put on trial, and the repression of those with pro-Soviet feelings in Yugoslavia lasting until 1956. This repression was marked by significant violations of human rights.   Context: Prime Minister Josip Broz Tito met with the president of the Bishops' Conference of Yugoslavia, Aloysius Stepinac on 4 June 1945, two days after his release from imprisonment. The two could not reach an agreement on the state of the Catholic Church. Under Stepinac's leadership, the bishops' conference released a letter condemning alleged Partisan war crimes in September, 1945. The following year Stepinac was arrested and put on trial. In October 1946, in its first special session for 75 years, the Vatican excommunicated Tito and the Yugoslav government for sentencing Stepinac to 16 years in prison on charges of assisting Ustaše terror and of supporting forced conversions of Serbs to Catholicism. Stepinac received preferential treatment in recognition of his status and the sentence was soon shortened and reduced to house-arrest, with the option of emigration open to the archbishop.

Question: What are some traditional farming activities in mountain villages in Alpine countries?   Answer: Some traditional farming activities in mountain villages in Alpine countries include haymaking, cheesemaking, carpentry, woodcarving, baking and pastry-making.   Context: Cheesemaking is an ancient tradition in most Alpine countries. A wheel of cheese from the Emmental in Switzerland can weigh up to 45 kg (100 lb), and the Beaufort in Savoy can weight up to 70 kilograms (150 lb). Owners of the cows traditionally receive from the cheesemakers a portion in relation to the proportion of the cows' milk from the summer months in the high alps. Haymaking is an important farming activity in mountain villages which has become somewhat mechanized in recent years, although the slopes are so steep that usually scythes are necessary to cut the grass. Hay is normally brought in twice a year, often also on festival days.

Question: What factors have contributed to the shift in adult contemporary music radio stations playing the same songs as top 40 and adult top 40, but only after the hits have become established?   Answer: The factors that have contributed to the shift in adult contemporary music radio stations playing the same songs as top 40 and adult top 40, but only after the hits have become established include the increasing popularity of pop music, the desire of radio stations to remain competitive, and the need to keep listeners engaged. Additionally, the rise of streaming services has made it easier for radio stations to access new music, allowing them to keep up with the latest trends. Finally, the increased availability of data has allowed radio stations to better understand their audiences and tailor their playlists accordingly.   Context: A notable pattern that developed during the 2000s and 2010s has been for certain pop songs to have lengthy runs on AC charts, even after the songs have fallen off the Hot 100. Adrian Moreira, senior vice president for adult music for RCA Music Group, said, "We've seen a fairly tidal shift in what AC will play". Rather than emphasizing older songs, adult contemporary was playing many of the same songs as top 40 and adult top 40, but only after the hits had become established.

Question: What controversies have arisen regarding the legal disposition in Alsace-Moselle that provides public subsidies to certain religious groups while excluding others?   Answer: Controversies have arisen regarding the legal disposition in Alsace-Moselle that provides public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues, while excluding other religions. This has led to debates about the appropriateness of this arrangement and the exclusion of other religions from it.   Context: Most of the Alsatian population is Roman Catholic, but, largely because of the region's German heritage, a significant Protestant community also exists: today, the EPCAAL (a Lutheran church) is France's second largest Protestant church, also forming an administrative union (UEPAL) with the much smaller Calvinist EPRAL. Unlike the rest of France, the Local law in Alsace-Moselle still provides for to the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 and the organic articles, which provides public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues; religion classes in one of these faiths is compulsory in public schools. This divergence in policy from the French majority is due to the region having been part of Imperial Germany when the 1905 law separating the French church and state was instituted (for a more comprehensive history, see: Alsace-Lorraine).

The Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and his soldiers discovered the Aztec Empire's use of cochineal as a source of red dye. 2. Cochineal was much stronger than the Kermes of Poland, and worked particularly well on silk, satin and other luxury textiles. 3. The Spanish sent the first shipment of cochineal to Europe in 1523. 4. Carmine, the red dye made from cochineal, was more vibrant and had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. 5. The painters of the early Renaissance used carmine in their works, leading to its widespread use.   Context: But early in the 16th century, a brilliant new red appeared in Europe. When the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and his soldiers conquered the Aztec Empire in 1519-1521, they discovered slowly that the Aztecs had another treasure beside silver and gold; they had the tiny cochineal, a parasitic scale insect which lived on cactus plants, which, when dried and crushed, made a magnificent red. The cochineal in Mexico was closely related to the Kermes varieties of Europe, but unlike European Kermes, it could be harvested several times a year, and it was ten times stronger than the Kermes of Poland. It worked particularly well on silk, satin and other luxury textiles. In 1523 Cortes sent the first shipment to Spain.

Question: What is the significance of the lock groove in gramophone records and how does it affect the playback experience on automatic turntables?   Answer: The lock groove is the section of the gramophone record where the groove joins itself to form a complete circle. When the stylus reaches this point, it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record. On some recordings, the sound continues on the lock groove, which gives a strange repeating effect. Automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm, as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove, to trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record. However, due to this mechanism, most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the lock groove, since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove. This affects the playback experience on automatic turntables, as they are unable to play the sound that continues on the lock groove.   Context: Towards the center, at the end of the groove, there is another wide-pitched section known as the lead-out. At the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a complete circle, called the lock groove; when the stylus reaches this point, it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record. On some recordings (for example Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles, Super Trouper by Abba and Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd), the sound continues on the lock groove, which gives a strange repeating effect. Automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm, as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove, to trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record. Precisely because of this mechanism, most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the lock groove, since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove.   Score: 0.911939085 
Question: What factors contributed to the shift from precision bombing to area attack during The Blitz, and how did this impact the targeting of civilian property?   Answer: The shift from precision bombing to area attack during The Blitz was largely due to the inaccuracy of navigation and the effectiveness of British countermeasures against Knickebein, which was designed to avoid area attacks. This shift was indicated in the tactical methods and weapons dropped, such as the increased use of incendiaries, which were inherently inaccurate, and the cessation of parachute flares in favor of explosive target markers. As a result, much less care was taken to avoid civilian property close to industrial sites, and German air crews indicated that the homes of industrial workers were deliberately targeted.   Context: These decisions, apparently taken at the Luftflotte or Fliegerkorps level (see Organisation of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)), meant attacks on individual targets were gradually replaced by what was, for all intents and purposes, an unrestricted area attack or Terrorangriff (Terror Attack). Part of the reason for this was inaccuracy of navigation. The effectiveness of British countermeasures against Knickebein, which was designed to avoid area attacks, forced the Luftwaffe to resort to these methods. The shift from precision bombing to area attack is indicated in the tactical methods and weapons dropped. KGr 100 increased its use of incendiaries from 13–28 percent. By December, this had increased to 92 percent. Use of incendiaries, which were inherently inaccurate, indicated much less care was taken to avoid civilian property close to industrial sites. Other units ceased using parachute flares and opted for explosive target markers. Captured German air crews also indicated the homes of industrial workers were deliberately targeted.

Question: What are some measures taken by governments or private organizations to protect biodiversity and landscape conservation in national parks and nature reserves?   Answer: Some measures taken by governments or private organizations to protect biodiversity and landscape conservation in national parks and nature reserves include: - Limiting the number of visitors allowed to enter certain fragile areas. - Designating trails or roads for visitors. - Allowing visitors to enter only for study, cultural, and recreation purposes. - Prohibiting forestry operations, grazing of animals, and hunting of animals. - Banning exploitation of habitat or wildlife.   Context: National park and nature reserve is the area selected by governments or private organizations for special protection against damage or degradation with the objective of biodiversity and landscape conservation. National parks are usually owned and managed by national or state governments. A limit is placed on the number of visitors permitted to enter certain fragile areas. Designated trails or roads are created. The visitors are allowed to enter only for study, cultural and recreation purposes. Forestry operations, grazing of animals and hunting of animals are prohibited. Exploitation of habitat or wildlife is banned.   Score: 0.89988023 
Question: What were the key events that led to the Confederate evacuation of Richmond in March and April 1865?   Answer: The key events that led to the Confederate evacuation of Richmond in March and April 1865 were the failed attack on Fort Stedman by Confederate General John B. Gordon on March 25, the Union Sixth Corps breaking through Confederate lines on Boydton Plank Road south of Petersburg on April 1, and the Union victory at the Five Forks junction on April 1, which resulted in thousands of Confederate prisoners and encouraged General Grant to order a general advance.   Context: Three years later, as March 1865 ended, the Confederate capitol became indefensible. On March 25, Confederate General John B. Gordon's desperate attack on Fort Stedman east of Petersburg failed. On April 1, General Philip Sheridan, assigned to interdict the Southside Railroad, met brigades commanded by George Pickett at the Five Forks junction, smashing them, taking thousands of prisoners, and encouraging General Grant to order a general advance. When the Union Sixth Corps broke through Confederate lines on Boydton Plank Road south of Petersburg, Confederate casualties exceeded 5000, or about a tenth of Lee's defending army. General Lee then informed Jefferson Davis that he was about to evacuate Richmond.   Score: 0.8800354 
Question: What are some notable features of Switzerland's rail network and how does it contribute to the country's transportation system?   Answer: Switzerland's rail network is notable for its density, with 5,063 km (3,146 mi) of track carrying over 350 million passengers annually. This makes it the most dense rail network in Europe and the Swiss citizens the keenest rail users, travelling on average 2,258 km (1,403 mi) by rail each year. The network is mainly administered by the Federal Railways, with the exception of the 366 km (227 mi) narrow gauge railway in Graubünden, which is operated by the Rhaetian Railways. This railway includes some World Heritage lines. Additionally, the AlpTransit project is underway to build new railway base tunnels through the Alps, which will reduce the time of travel between north and south. This contributes to the country's transportation system by providing a reliable and efficient way to travel between different parts of the country.

Question: What were some of the key elements of the public sphere during the Age of Enlightenment and how did it challenge the traditional authority of the state and religious institutions?   Answer: The key elements of the public sphere during the Age of Enlightenment were egalitarianism, open discussion of topics of "common concern," and the use of reason as the basis for argument. This challenged the traditional authority of the state and religious institutions by allowing for critical examination of their policies and beliefs by the public. This allowed for a more open and accessible form of communication and debate, which was previously the exclusive domain of the state and religious authorities. The public sphere also encouraged the opposition of secrecy of all sorts, which further challenged the traditional authority of the state and religious institutions.   Context: One of the primary elements of the culture of the Enlightenment was the rise of the public sphere, a "realm of communication marked by new arenas of debate, more open and accessible forms of urban public space and sociability, and an explosion of print culture," in the late 17th century and 18th century. Elements of the public sphere included: it was egalitarian, it discussed the domain of "common concern," and argument was founded on reason. Habermas uses the term "common concern" to describe those areas of political/social knowledge and discussion that were previously the exclusive territory of the state and religious authorities, now open to critical examination by the public sphere. The values of this bourgeois public sphere included holding reason to be supreme, considering everything to be open to criticism (the public sphere is critical), and the opposition of secrecy of all sorts.

Question: What were some of the talents and interests that Alexander Graham Bell possessed during his early years, and how did they shape his relationship with his mother?   Answer: Alexander Graham Bell possessed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music during his early years. His mother encouraged these talents, and he eventually became the family's pianist. He also enjoyed mimicry and "voice tricks" akin to ventriloquism, which entertained family guests. His mother's gradual deafness had a profound effect on Bell, and he learned a manual finger language so he could communicate with her. He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead, allowing her to hear him with reasonable clarity. This preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study acoustics. These talents and interests shaped Bell's relationship with his mother by allowing him to communicate with her despite her deafness, and by providing her with entertainment.   Context: From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist. Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and "voice tricks" akin to ventriloquism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits. Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour.

Answer: In the 20th century, Philadelphia faced a number of challenges, particularly in terms of corruption, race relations, and law enforcement. Corruption was rampant, with a complacent population and an entrenched Republican political machine. Race relations were strained, with a race riot of ethnic whites against blacks during Red Summer in 1919, and public flouting of Prohibition laws, mob violence, and police involvement in illegal activities. Law enforcement was inadequate, leading to the appointment of Brigadier General Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as director of public safety, but political pressure prevented any long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.   Context: By the 20th century, Philadelphia had become known as "corrupt and contented", with a complacent population and an entrenched Republican political machine. The first major reform came in 1917 when outrage over the election-year murder of a police officer led to the shrinking of the Philadelphia City Council from two houses to just one. In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot of ethnic whites against blacks during Red Summer, in post-World War I unrest, as recent immigrants competed with blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of Prohibition laws, mob violence, and police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brigadier General Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as director of public safety, but political pressure prevented any long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.

Question: What factors contributed to the resurgence of vinyl record sales in 2014, while other physical music mediums experienced a decline?   Answer: The resurgence of vinyl record sales in 2014 can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, the increasing popularity of retro-style music and the nostalgia associated with vinyl records has made them more desirable to music fans. Secondly, the sound quality of vinyl records is often considered to be superior to other physical music mediums, such as compact discs. Thirdly, the tactile experience of playing a vinyl record is often seen as more enjoyable than playing digital music. Finally, the increasing availability of vinyl records in stores and online has made them more accessible to consumers.   Context: In 2014 artist Jack White sold 40,000 copies of his second solo release, Lazaretto, on vinyl. The sales of the record beat the largest sales in one week on vinyl since 1991. The sales record was previously held by Pearl Jam's, Vitalogy, which sold 34,000 copies in one week in 1994.

Question: What impact did the "Kensington System" have on Queen Victoria's childhood and development?   Answer: The "Kensington System" had a significant impact on Queen Victoria's childhood and development. It isolated her from other children and prevented her from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable. It also rendered her weak and dependent upon them, and prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that she avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. As a result, Victoria's childhood was "rather melancholy" and she was not able to experience a normal childhood.   Context: Victoria later described her childhood as "rather melancholy". Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called "Kensington System", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety.

Question: What are the distinctive features of the three-way distinction in stops and affricates in Wu Chinese?   Answer: The three-way distinction in stops and affricates in Wu Chinese is distinguished by aspiration, voicing, and pitch. Aspirated consonants are voiceless and pronounced with a strong burst of air, unaspirated consonants are voiced and pronounced without a strong burst of air, and muddy consonants are weakly voiced and pronounced with slack or breathy voice.

Question: What factors contributed to the introduction of comprehensive schools in Ireland in 1966 and how did they differ from the existing vocational school system?   Answer: The introduction of comprehensive schools in Ireland in 1966 was largely driven by the need to provide a broader range of education than the existing vocational school system. This was in response to the fact that education in Ireland was largely dominated by religious persuasion, particularly the voluntary secondary school system. The comprehensive school system was designed to provide a more secular education, with a focus on academic subjects rather than vocational training. This system also allowed for more flexibility in terms of curriculum and student choice, as well as providing a more equitable education system for all students regardless of their background. The comprehensive school system also allowed for more collaboration between schools and the local community, which was not possible under the vocational school system.   Context: Comprehensive schools were introduced into Ireland in 1966 by an initiative by Patrick Hillery, Minister for Education, to give a broader range of education compared to that of the vocational school system, which was then the only system of schools completely controlled by the state. Until then, education in Ireland was largely dominated by religious persuasion, particularly the voluntary secondary school system was a particular realisation of this.

Question: What were some of the negative consequences of Alexander Graham Bell's efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language and promote oral communication among the deaf?   Answer: Some of the negative consequences of Alexander Graham Bell's efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language and promote oral communication among the deaf include mistreatment of deaf children in schools, exclusion of the deaf from wider society, and a negative view of Bell by those embracing Deaf culture. In some schools, children were mistreated by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing, the only language they knew, in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication. This mistreatment of deaf children in schools was a direct result of Bell's efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language. Additionally, Bell's efforts to promote oral communication among the deaf resulted in the exclusion of the deaf from wider society, as they were unable to communicate effectively with those who did not understand sign language. Finally, Bell's efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language and promote oral communication among the deaf have resulted in a negative view of Bell by those embracing Deaf culture.   Context: Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language, thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded. In several schools, children were mistreated, for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing—the only language they knew—in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication.

Question: What are some arguments made by economists regarding the impact of corruption on economic development in Africa and Asia?   Answer: Economists argue that corruption has had a negative impact on economic development in Africa and Asia. In Africa, corruption has primarily taken the form of rent extraction, with the resulting financial capital moved overseas rather than invested at home. This has resulted in a lack of investment in the local economy, leading to slower economic growth. In Asia, corruption has been linked to a lack of transparency and accountability in government, leading to a lack of trust in the government and a lack of investment in the economy. Additionally, corruption has been linked to a lack of access to resources, such as health services, which can further impede economic development.   Context: Economists argue that one of the factors behind the differing economic development in Africa and Asia is that in Africa, corruption has primarily taken the form of rent extraction with the resulting financial capital moved overseas rather than invested at home (hence the stereotypical, but often accurate, image of African dictators having Swiss bank accounts).

Question: How does Avicenna differentiate between the metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency in his analysis of the essence-attributes question?   Answer: Avicenna differentiates between the metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency by arguing that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (mumkin bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The Necessary exists 'due-to-Its-Self', and has no quiddity/essence (mahiyya) other than existence (wujud). Furthermore, It is 'One' (wahid ahad) since there cannot be more than one 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' without differentia (fasl) to distinguish them from each other.   Context: Avicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (mumkin bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'.

Question: What were some of the key factors that contributed to the success of the Thames River Police force in its first year of operation?   Answer: The key factors that contributed to the success of the Thames River Police force in its first year of operation were the initial investment of £4,200, the policing of 33,000 workers in the river trades, the saving of £122,000 worth of cargo, and the rescuing of several lives. Additionally, the Marine Police Bill, which transformed the force from a private to public police agency, was a major factor in its success.   Context: With the initial investment of £4,200, the new trial force of the Thames River Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades, of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and "on the game." The force was a success after its first year, and his men had "established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives." Word of this success spread quickly, and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800, transforming it from a private to public police agency; now the oldest police force in the world.

Question: What are some potential psychological and social consequences of early puberty in boys?   Answer: Potential psychological and social consequences of early puberty in boys include increased confidence and independence, a good body image, and increased attention from potential partners. However, early puberty can also be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones, increased social pressure to conform to adult norms, and an increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.   Context: The timing of puberty can have important psychological and social consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often tend to have a good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys are more likely to be sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.   Score: 0.903692722

The success of Zig et Puce in 1925, which popularized the use of speech balloons in European comics. 3. The serialization of The Adventures of Tintin in newspaper comics supplements beginning in 1929. 4. The rise of Franco-Belgian comics in the mid-20th century.   Context: The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as The Adventures of Tintin. American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (manga) propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. Comics has had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.   Score: 0.900928617

Additionally, the film provides a minor retcon to the continuity of the previous films by reimagining the Quantum organisation as a division within Spectre rather than an independent organisation.   Context: Despite being an original story, Spectre draws on Ian Fleming's source material, most notably in the character of Franz Oberhauser, played by Christoph Waltz. Oberhauser shares his name with Hannes Oberhauser, a background character in the short story "Octopussy" from the Octopussy and The Living Daylights collection, and who is named in the film as having been a temporary legal guardian of a young Bond in 1983. Similarly, Charmian Bond is shown to have been his full-time guardian, observing the back story established by Fleming. With the acquisition of the rights to Spectre and its associated characters, screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade revealed that the film would provide a minor retcon to the continuity of the previous films, with the Quantum organisation alluded to in Casino Royale and introduced in Quantum of Solace reimagined as a division within Spectre rather than an independent organisation.

Question: What challenges arise in defining literature based on its "poeticity" or "literariness" and how do these definitions relate to ordinary language use?   Answer: The challenge in defining literature based on its "poeticity" or "literariness" is that in order to say that literature deviates from ordinary uses of language, those uses must first be identified. This is difficult because "ordinary language" is an unstable category, differing according to social categories and across history. Therefore, it is difficult to determine what is considered "literary" or "poetic" and what is considered "ordinary" language. This difficulty in defining literature based on its "poeticity" or "literariness" is further complicated by the fact that the definition of "ordinary language" is constantly changing.   Context: The formalist definition is that the history of "literature" foregrounds poetic effects; it is the "literariness" or "poeticity" of literature that distinguishes it from ordinary speech or other kinds of writing (e.g., journalism). Jim Meyer considers this a useful characteristic in explaining the use of the term to mean published material in a particular field (e.g., "scientific literature"), as such writing must use language according to particular standards. The problem with the formalist definition is that in order to say that literature deviates from ordinary uses of language, those uses must first be identified; this is difficult because "ordinary language" is an unstable category, differing according to social categories and across history.

Question: What were some of the consequences of the crusades, both in terms of religious conflicts and societal impacts?   Answer: The crusades had a number of consequences, both in terms of religious conflicts and societal impacts. On the religious front, the crusades led to increased tensions between Christians and Muslims, as well as between Christians and Jews. The pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East were especially brutal during the First Crusade, leading to the destruction of Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms. On the societal front, the crusades led to the establishment of trade routes that would eventually become the Silk Road, and allowed the merchant republics of Genoa and Venice to become major economic powers. The Reconquista, a related movement, worked to reconquer Iberia for Christendom. The crusades also led to the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.   Context: The period known as the Crusades, a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the Levant back into Christian rule, began. Several Crusader states were founded in the eastern Mediterranean. These were all short-lived. The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe. Their Sack of Constantinople in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire. Though it would later be re-established, it would never recover its former glory. The Crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the Silk Road and open the way for the merchant republics of Genoa and Venice to become major economic powers.

Question: What is the significance of Melbourne's tram network in terms of its size, historical origins, and integration with other transportation systems?   Answer: The significance of Melbourne's tram network is its size, historical origins, and integration with other transportation systems. The network is the largest in the world, having its origins in the city's 1880s land boom. It consists of 250 km (155.3 mi) of track, 487 trams, 25 routes, and 1,763 tram stops. Around 80 per cent of the network shares road space with other vehicles, while the rest of the network is separated or are light rail routes. This integration with other transportation systems allows for greater access to the city and its surrounding areas. Additionally, the trams are recognised as iconic cultural assets and a tourist attraction, with heritage trams operating on the free City Circle route and heritage restaurant trams travelling through the city and surrounding areas during the evening.   Context: Melbourne has the largest tram network in the world which had its origins in the city's 1880s land boom. In 2013–2014, 176.9 million passenger trips were made by tram. Melbourne's is Australia's only tram network to comprise more than a single line and consists of 250 km (155.3 mi) of track, 487 trams, 25 routes, and 1,763 tram stops.

Question: What factors influenced the Soviet Union's decision to replace Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov in May 1939, and how did this change impact negotiations with Germany and the ongoing talks with Britain and France?   Answer: The Soviet Union's decision to replace Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov in May 1939 was influenced by Litvinov's Jewish ethnicity, which was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, and his prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin. The change impacted negotiations with Germany by signaling to them that the USSR was open to offers, and it impacted the ongoing talks with Britain and France by signaling to them the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. Additionally, the change allowed the Soviets to pursue faster-paced German negotiations without abandoning British–French talks, as Molotov was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Furthermore, Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British–French talks, as Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.   Context: Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to "purge the ministry of Jews." Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's "modus operandi" was "more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan." Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British–French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British–French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.   Score: 0.878301084 
Question: What were some of the reforms enacted by the Han government to support small landowner-cultivators and prevent them from falling into debt?   Answer: The reforms enacted by the Han government to support small landowner-cultivators and prevent them from falling into debt included reducing taxes, granting temporary remissions of taxes, granting loans, and providing landless peasants with temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts.   Context: The small landowner-cultivators formed the majority of the Han tax base; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords. The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms. These reforms included reducing taxes, temporary remissions of taxes, granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts.

Question: What are some factors that contribute to the increased value of certain coins beyond their face value?   Answer: 1. Numismatic value: Coins that are rare or have a unique design can be worth more than their face value due to their collectability. 2. Precious metal value: Coins that are made of gold or silver can be worth more than their face value due to the value of the metal. 3. Error coins: Coins that have errors in their production can be worth more than their face value due to their rarity. 4. Limited production: Coins that are produced in limited quantities can be worth more than their face value due to their scarcity.   Context: Technically, all these coins are still legal tender at face value, though some are far more valuable today for their numismatic value, and for gold and silver coins, their precious metal value. From 1965 to 1970 the Kennedy half dollar was the only circulating coin with any silver content, which was removed in 1971 and replaced with cupronickel. However, since 1992, the U.S. Mint has produced special Silver Proof Sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes, quarters, and half dollars in place of the standard copper-nickel versions.

Question: What were the motivations behind the establishment of Yale University and how did a group of Congregationalist ministers contribute to its formation?   Answer: The motivations behind the establishment of Yale University were to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. A group of ten Congregationalist ministers, all alumni of Harvard, pooled their books to form the school's library. This group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as "The Founders". Elihu Yale, a successful businessman, was also contacted to provide financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Additionally, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale, which had a profound effect on the intellectuals at Yale.   Context: In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted a successful businessman named Elihu Yale, who lived in Wales but had been born in Boston and whose father, David, had been one of the original settlers in New Haven, to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology. It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the "new divinity." In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith.

Answer: John von Neumann made significant contributions to the field of computing and automata, including the development of the Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing, and the concept of a universal constructor. He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.   Context: Stochastic computing was first introduced in a pioneering paper by von Neumann in 1953. However, the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s. He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth.

Answer: The controversial elections in 2002 in the Republic of the Congo had a significant impact on the political landscape and the power of the president. The new constitution, agreed upon by referendum, granted the president new powers, extended his term to seven years, and introduced a new bicameral assembly. This gave the president more control over the government and increased his power. Additionally, the election was marred by fraud and irregularities, which further solidified the president's power.

Question: What were some of the key reforms implemented by Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Revolutionary Command Council during their governance in Egypt?   Answer: Some of the key reforms implemented by Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Revolutionary Command Council during their governance in Egypt included agrarian reform, abolition of the monarchy, and reorganization of political parties.   Context: On 18 June 1953, the monarchy was abolished and the Republic of Egypt declared, with Naguib as its first president. According to Aburish, after assuming power, Nasser and the Free Officers expected to become the "guardians of the people's interests" against the monarchy and the pasha class while leaving the day-to-day tasks of government to civilians. They asked former prime minister Ali Maher to accept reappointment to his previous position, and to form an all-civilian cabinet. The Free Officers then governed as the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) with Naguib as chairman and Nasser as vice-chairman. Relations between the RCC and Maher grew tense, however, as the latter viewed many of Nasser's schemes—agrarian reform, abolition of the monarchy, reorganization of political parties—as too radical, culminating in Maher's resignation on 7 September. Naguib assumed the additional role of prime minister, and Nasser that of deputy prime minister. In September, the Agrarian Reform Law was put into effect. In Nasser's eyes, this law gave the RCC its own identity and transformed the coup into a revolution.   Score: 0.885768294 
Question: How does the presence of perfective and imperfective aspects compensate for the lack of tenses in the Štokavian verb?   Answer: The presence of perfective and imperfective aspects in the Štokavian verb compensates for the lack of tenses by indicating whether the action is completed or in progress in the referred time. The imperfective aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished, in progress, or repetitive; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the action was completed, instantaneous, or of limited duration. This allows for a greater range of expression than would be possible with just tenses alone.   Context: In addition, like most Slavic languages, the Shtokavian verb also has one of two aspects: perfective or imperfective. Most verbs come in pairs, with the perfective verb being created out of the imperfective by adding a prefix or making a stem change. The imperfective aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished, in progress, or repetitive; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the action was completed, instantaneous, or of limited duration. Some Štokavian tenses (namely, aorist and imperfect) favor a particular aspect (but they are rarer or absent in Čakavian and Kajkavian). Actually, aspects "compensate" for the relative lack of tenses, because aspect of the verb determines whether the act is completed or in progress in the referred time.   Score: 0.919675946

Question: What factors have contributed to the decrease in executions of juvenile offenders in the United States since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976?   Answer: The factors that have contributed to the decrease in executions of juvenile offenders in the United States since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 include the slow process of appeals, the rarity of condemned persons being under 18 at the time of execution, and the increasing awareness of the immaturity of juvenile offenders. Additionally, the Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to execute juvenile offenders for crimes committed before the age of 18. This ruling has had a significant impact on the number of executions of juvenile offenders in the United States.   Context: Since 1642 (in the 13 colonies, the United States under the Articles of Confederation, and the current United States) an estimated 364 juvenile offenders have been put to death by the states and the federal government. The earliest known execution of a prisoner for crimes committed as a juvenile was Thomas Graunger in 1642. Twenty-two of the executions occurred after 1976, in seven states. Due to the slow process of appeals, it was highly unusual for a condemned person to be under 18 at the time of execution. The youngest person to be executed in the 20th century was George Stinney, who was electrocuted in South Carolina at the age of 14 on June 16, 1944. The last execution of a juvenile may have been Leonard Shockley, who died in the Maryland gas chamber on April 10, 1959, at the age of 17. No one has been under age 19 at time of execution since at least 1964. Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976, 22 people have been executed for crimes committed under the age of 18.

Eisenhower opposed the use of atomic bombs against the Japanese, writing, "First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon." Initially, Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets. He even visited Warsaw in 1945.   Context: In November 1945, Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army. His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping. Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs. However, in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets, Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon. Indeed, Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, "First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon." Initially, Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets. He even visited Warsaw in 1945. Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city.

Question: What are the factors that determine the capacitance of a capacitor?   Answer: The factors that determine the capacitance of a capacitor are the type of dielectric, ambient operating and storage temperatures, operating voltage, and the plate area and separation between the plates. Additionally, the presence of fringing fields outside the dielectric can also affect the capacitance.   Context: The capacitance of certain capacitors decreases as the component ages. In ceramic capacitors, this is caused by degradation of the dielectric. The type of dielectric, ambient operating and storage temperatures are the most significant aging factors, while the operating voltage has a smaller effect. The aging process may be reversed by heating the component above the Curie point. Aging is fastest near the beginning of life of the component, and the device stabilizes over time. Electrolytic capacitors age as the electrolyte evaporates. In contrast with ceramic capacitors, this occurs towards the end of life of the component.   Score: 0.853073597

Question: What factors have contributed to the decline of ancient and distinct Jewish languages in various communities around the world?   Answer: The factors that have contributed to the decline of ancient and distinct Jewish languages in various communities around the world include the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry, the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries, and widespread emigration from other Jewish communities around the world. Additionally, the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel, as well as the adoption of English by many Jewish communities, have also contributed to the decline of these languages.

Question: What are some possible causes of surges in glaciers, and how do these surges affect the movement and velocity of the glaciers?   Answer: Possible causes of surges in glaciers include failure of the underlying bedrock, the pooling of meltwater at the base of the glacier, and the accumulation of mass beyond a critical "tipping point". During these surges, the glacier may reach velocities far greater than normal speed, up to 90 m (300 ft) per day. The surge causes the glacier to move faster and more erratically, resulting in the formation of crevasses in the fracture zone due to differences in glacier velocity. Intersecting crevasses can create isolated peaks in the ice, called seracs.   Context: A few glaciers have periods of very rapid advancement called surges. These glaciers exhibit normal movement until suddenly they accelerate, then return to their previous state. During these surges, the glacier may reach velocities far greater than normal speed. These surges may be caused by failure of the underlying bedrock, the pooling of meltwater at the base of the glacier — perhaps delivered from a supraglacial lake — or the simple accumulation of mass beyond a critical "tipping point". Temporary rates up to 90 m (300 ft) per day have occurred when increased temperature or overlying pressure caused bottom ice to melt and water to accumulate beneath a glacier.   Score: 0.908112645 
Question: What were the main factors that led to Japan's defeat in the Pacific War, particularly in the battle of Imphal, resulting in the loss of over 50,000 troops to starvation and disease?   Answer: The main factors that led to Japan's defeat in the Pacific War, particularly in the battle of Imphal, were the Allies' superior supply arrangements, the Japanese troops' lack of resources, and the Allies' successful advances from both Kohima and Imphal. The Japanese troops were unable to maintain their forces due to their inadequate supply arrangements, leading to starvation and disease among the troops. The Allies' successful advances from both Kohima and Imphal ultimately broke the Japanese siege of Imphal, resulting in the loss of over 50,000 Japanese troops.   Context: As many Japanese had feared, Japan's supply arrangements could not maintain her forces. Once Mutaguchi's hopes for an early victory were thwarted, his troops, particularly those at Kohima, starved. During May, while Mutaguchi continued to order attacks, the Allies advanced southwards from Kohima and northwards from Imphal. The two Allied attacks met on 22 June, breaking the Japanese siege of Imphal. The Japanese finally broke off the operation on 3 July.

Question: What does Alfred North Whitehead mean by "symbolic reference" and how does it manifest in the perception of higher organisms like humans and animals?   Answer: Alfred North Whitehead's concept of "symbolic reference" refers to the way in which higher organisms, such as humans and animals, combine their sense perceptions with causal relationships to form a mental image of the world. This process is so automatic that it is difficult to refrain from it. As an example, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. However, an artist might not jump to the same conclusion, instead stopping to admire the color and shape. Similarly, a dog would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such. In this way, symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions and causal relationships, with the causal relationships dominating the more basic mentality.   Context: In higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms "symbolic reference", which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, "might not have jumped to the notion of a chair", but instead "might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape." This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Moreover, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog "would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such." In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).

Question: What were the long-term consequences of the Herero and Namaqua genocide in Namibia, particularly in relation to policies of dispossession, deportation, forced labor, racial segregation, and discrimination that foreshadowed apartheid?   Answer: The long-term consequences of the Herero and Namaqua genocide in Namibia were devastating. Survivors of the genocide were subjected to a policy of dispossession, deportation, forced labor, racial segregation, and discrimination that foreshadowed apartheid. This policy of oppression and discrimination has had a lasting impact on the Namibian people, with many still facing the effects of the genocide today. The legacy of the genocide has also had a lasting impact on the country's political and social landscape, with many of the policies of dispossession, deportation, forced labor, racial segregation, and discrimination that foreshadowed apartheid still in place today.   Context: From 1904 to 1907, the Herero and the Namaqua took up arms against the Germans and in calculated punitive action by the German occupiers, the 'first genocide of the Twentieth Century' was committed. In the Herero and Namaqua genocide, 10,000 Nama (half the population) and approximately 65,000 Hereros (about 80% of the population) were systematically murdered.

Question: What evidence suggests that early-Ming Nanjing had extensive global connections and interactions with foreign dignitaries?   Answer: The evidence that suggests that early-Ming Nanjing had extensive global connections and interactions with foreign dignitaries is the fact that it was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (Boni 渤泥), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored. This suggests that Nanjing had a long history of interactions with foreign dignitaries and was a hub of global connections.   Context: As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (Boni 渤泥), who died during his visit to China in 1408.

Question: What were the consequences of the Japanese establishment of a major base in the Australian Territory of New Guinea during the Pacific War?   Answer: The consequences of the Japanese establishment of a major base in the Australian Territory of New Guinea during the Pacific War included increased air raids on the Australian mainland, the advancement of Japanese land forces in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and the need for Australian reserve battalions to fight a rearguard action against the Japanese advance. This ultimately led to the Battle for Australia, as Prime Minister Curtin predicted, and the Japanese were eventually beaten back by Allied forces at Milne Bay.   Context: Australia had been shocked by the speedy collapse of British Malaya and Fall of Singapore in which around 15,000 Australian soldiers became prisoners of war. Curtin predicted that the "battle for Australia" would now follow. The Japanese established a major base in the Australian Territory of New Guinea in early 1942. On 19 February, Darwin suffered a devastating air raid, the first time the Australian mainland had been attacked. Over the following 19 months, Australia was attacked from the air almost 100 times.

Question: What factors contribute to the significant variation in climate across the island of Saint Helena?   Answer: The factors that contribute to the significant variation in climate across the island of Saint Helena include the Benguela Current, trade winds, elevation, and the presence of vegetation. The Benguela Current and trade winds help to temper the climate, while the elevation of the island affects temperatures and rainfall. The presence of vegetation, such as the New Zealand flax and the Millennium Forest project, also affects the climate by providing shade and moisture.   Context: The climate of Saint Helena is tropical, marine and mild, tempered by the Benguela Current and trade winds that blow almost continuously. The climate varies noticeably across the island. Temperatures in Jamestown, on the north leeward shore, range between 21–28 °C (70–82 °F) in the summer (January to April) and 17–24 °C (63–75 °F) during the remainder of the year. The temperatures in the central areas are, on average, 5–6 °C (9.0–10.8 °F) lower. Jamestown also has a very low annual rainfall, while 750–1,000 mm (30–39 in) falls per year on the higher ground and the south coast, where it is also noticeably cloudier. There are weather recording stations in the Longwood and Blue Hill districts.   Score: 0.878539801 
Question: What is the significance of the hadith that states only Mary and Jesus were born without the "touch of Satan" in the context of exonerating Mary and her child from charges made against them?   Answer: The hadith that states only Mary and Jesus were born without the "touch of Satan" is significant in the context of exonerating Mary and her child from the charges made against them because it serves as a reminder that Mary and Jesus were born without any influence from Satan, and thus any accusations of wrongdoing against them are unfounded. This is in keeping with the Quranic verse that states that Satan has no power over those who do not choose to follow him.   Context: Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam, the Quranic account does not confirm the Immaculate Conception exclusively for Mary as in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate, her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam. Moreover, Hannah's prayer in the Quran for her child to remain protected from Satan (Shayṭān) was said after it had already been born, not before and expresses a natural concern any righteous parent would have. The Muslim tradition or hadith, which states that the only children born without the "touch of Satan," were Mary and Jesus. should therefore not be taken in isolation from the Quran, and is to be interpreted within the specific context of exonerating Mary and her child from the charges that were made against them and is not a general statement. The specific mention of Mary and Jesus in this hadith may also be taken to represent a class of people, in keeping with the Arabic language and the Quranic verse [O Satan] surely thou shalt have no power over My servants, except such of the erring ones as choose to follow thee (15:42)   Score: 0.891036272
