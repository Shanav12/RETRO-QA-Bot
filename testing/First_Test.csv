, Why is induction a valid type of proof?, "The induction principle is considered a valid type of proof because it allows us to prove that a claim holds for all positive integers. It is based on the idea that if we can show that a claim holds for a base case (usually 1) and then prove that if the claim holds for any positive integer k, it also holds for k+1, then we can conclude that the claim holds for all positive integers. This is because the induction principle assumes that if the claim holds for a certain number, it will also hold for the next number, and so on, creating a chain of implications that covers all positive integers", Correct Answer, 
, What is proof by contradiction?, "The concept of proof by contradiction in mathematics involves assuming that the claim we are trying to prove is false and then reaching a contradiction.
